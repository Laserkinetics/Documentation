== SnakeSys Firmware Release Notes (B4, R4, T2)

=== Version V213

==== All Products (Improve Policy For Save Of Settings)

Reduced the required time that the user needed to wait for units to save their Net-Manager DMX port settings to flash memory from 30 seconds to 15 seconds.

Network IP and Subnet-Mask settings that are adjusted from the Net-Manager are now saved to flash memory immediately.

Synchronisation settings were not previously saved, they are now saved immediately to flash after adjustment via the Net-Manager.

Fixed a bug which caused a longer delay than expected before settings were written to flash memory.

=== Version V212

==== SnakeSys B4

Fixed issue when using Art-Net and ACN subnets 3-0 and above which would cause the DMX packet to be reduced to less than the full 512 values.  This potentially affects all versions V200 to V211 but was most noticeable in V210 and V211.

The above issue would also cause the DMX framing timings to be erroneously adjusted from the defaults when using Art-Net and ACN start universe above universe 0-0 up to universe 2-15.  The DMX output was within spec but could be slower than expected.  In Art-Net and ACN mode the subnet and universe selection were incorrectly being used to used to apply the timing settings from the buffer mode (as per the rear panel legend).
    
Fixed break interrupt issue with DMX input which was introduced in V211.

Changed operation of DMX in LED to work like the other products.
 
=== Version V211

==== SnakeSys T2 Version 2

Added support for T2 Version 2 with DMX input option.

Added PCB version dependent menu items.
	
=== Version V210

==== SnakeSys R4

Increased timeout value for DMX input LED display.

Added optional software based break detect and also added DMX special mode to allow software based break detect:

R4 now has the ability to switch between hardware break detect or software break detect, so users who experience the CPLD.v1 break detect issue can still get the unit to receive DMX correctly:
	This is done by holding the DMX button on the front-panel for 5 seconds until it starts flashing.
	Once the button is flashing pressing the NET1 button will toggle between both break detect types:

NET1 Illuminated:          Software break detect
NET1 Off          Hardware break detect

Pressing again the DMX button will exit back to standard front-panel operation, and the state will be saved.

==== All Products

Fixed a timing issue with DMX receive where the output packet update did not take place until the next packet's break was received.  This could cause latency problems on systems with slow DMX refresh.

=== Version V209

==== All Products

Applied the Art-Net output hold fix to DMX to always hold the DMX output after valid Art-Net has been received and output as DMX. 

	
=== Version V208

==== SnakeSys T2

Support for SnakeSys T2 added.

=== Version V206

==== SnakeSys B4

Added support for storing of ChamNet settings.

=== Version V204

==== Snakesys R4

Fixed a bug where when the units settings were reset from the front-panel the POE ports were disabled. Since there is still no way to re-enable the ports in MagicQ this could be a serious issue for some end users.

Fixed a bug where the PoE ports were not turned off when the unit was placed in standby mode.

Changed operation of RDM filter button to match that of ART/ACN and IN / OUT with respect to ChamNet mode

==== Snakesys B4

Enabled break detect on DMX input

=== Version V203

==== Snakesys B4

Modified DMX input so that it can be enabled when outputs 1-4 are active

=== Version V202

==== Snakesys R4

In ChamNet mode the IN/OUT  and ART/ACN LEDs now reflect the current ChamNet settings, and will toggle if combined protocol or input / outputs are used.

==== All Products

Added notifications so MagicQ can detect when port settings are changed.


=== Version V201

==== Snakesys R4

Changed the operation the following buttons so that ChamNet does not get disabled when they are pressed:

DMX IN/OUT
ART/ACN
RDM FILTER

Fixed an issue with the thermal management regarding the fan, which now has a programmed minimum fan speed of 1500RPM, and starts instantly on power up,  and also improved the fan control system and sample rate.

==== All Products

ART: Updated the Art-Poll Reply packet to correctly report the products short and long names.

ACN: Minor change to the header to reflect a tiny version of the product name.

=== Version V200

Version 2 framework supporting both R4 and B4.
