Fixed problem with 1.6.5.1 and 1.6.5.2 which caused a backward compatibility problem on Compact and Pro consoles when changing back to software versions 1.6.1.7.  Run 1.6.5.3 or above before attempting to go back to 1.6.1.7.  See version 1.6.5.2 known features for info on how to downgrade directly from 1.6.5.2 to 1.6.1.7.
