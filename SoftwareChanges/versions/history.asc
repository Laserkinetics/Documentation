== Version 1.6.5.0

=== New Functions

This release now uses the new graphical toolkit for all variants including MQ40/60/70 and Pro 2010 consoles.  This enables improved graphical functions on these consoles including removing update flickers and allowing shaded buttons.

Note that MagicQ on Windows, Mac and Linux PC have already been using the new toolkit since version 1.5.8.6.

There is now a choice of 4 colour schemes:

* Grey (Default)
* Grey (High Contrast)
* Black (as used on MQ1000)
* Black Shaded

There are now more icons in use on the user interface - including icons on the Setup and Cue Stack tabs and also for groups and heads.

Note that as with all MagicQ software versions it is possible to return to the older software such as v1.6.1.7 from the software utility (Setup, View System, View Status, Change S/W).


==== Older Consoles

Customers with Pro consoles prior to Pro 2010, pre Pro consoles, and Expert consoles prior to 2014 (i.e. consoles that use the .cde download package) will need to upgrade their operating system disc.  Replacement system discs with the Pro 2014 operating system will be available for purchase from June 2014 - please contact your local MagicQ dealer.  

Customers with pre Pro and Pro consoles may also consider upgrading their hardware to full 2014 spec.

==== MagicHD

MagicHD now supports playback of media with audio. Please note that this feature is a beta release, and is limited to Windows platforms only. Playback works for media played forwards at 1x speed: it is not possible to speed up, slow down, or reverse the audio.

The Media Layer and Output Layer personalities have been updated to include audio parameters. The output layer has a Volume channel which controls the overall volume of all layers. Fading the output layer also fades the volume. Each media layer has an Audio Gain and Audio Pan channel. Gain is for equalising quiet clips. Pan moves the sound to the left or right channel. The layer's intensity also fades its audio. Audio settings are in the Intensity Window.

Audio playback requires the media's audio format to be 16 bit PCM. The media conversion process has been updated to include audio (previously audio was stripped to reduce file size). You are strongly advised to convert media before playing. If the format is not acceptable the audio will not play and error message(s) will be written to the log file.

The HUD has been updated to add audio level meters on top of the layer intensity bar, next to each layer's preview thumbnail. Note that the HUD no longer displays the Blend and Transition channels for each media layer. (These parameters are not fully supported anyway). They have made room for the two audio control channels.

=== Bug Fixes

Fixed problem with receive of MIDI notes on different MIDI channels.  MIDI Automs that specified a particular MIDI channel would not trigger correctly.  MIDI notes using the miditable.txt would also not trigger if a "Requested Chan Only" was set in Setup, View Settings, MIDI, MIDI In type. #0007427

Fixed problem in recent betas with Patch, Multiply which would incorrectly output values between 128 and 254.

== Version 1.6.1.7

=== Bug Fixes

Fixed major problem on MQ60 and MQ70 whereby after 24 hours the software could no longer write to the disc (for example to save show file).  This affected versions 1.5.9.7 to 1.6.1.6 inclusive.  We recommend avoiding these versions for MQ60 and MQ70 or soft reseting every 12 hours.  #0007438

Fixed problem with defaults on MagicHD in version 1.6.1.6.  Shows created on previous versions that used MagicHD would have incorrect keystoning which prevented an image being shown on the output.  Shows created in previous versions will be now be converted correctly to have default keystone and hence correct output image.

Fix cursor down problem in windows whereby pressing cursor down would sometimes lose the cursor.

Fix for when applying FX using palettes the selection window was not refreshed correctly.

== Version 1.6.1.6

=== New Functions

==== MagicHD

Added full 4 corner keystone to the output layer. This has resulted in minor changes to the output layer personality. Refer to the MagicHD manual for details.

=== Bug Fixes

Fixed problem with toggling playbacks on Execute and Extra wings that affected recent betas.

Fixed problem with MagicQ restarting in last used panel mode. #0006613

Fixed problem with Cue Storage setting "Use first free Group, Palette, Cue" which did not operate as expected.  #0005265, #0005716


== Version 1.6.1.4

=== New Functions

MagicHD

Added Posterise, Mask, Key, and Hue colour effects. Posterise reduces the colour levels in the media, making is look like a poster. Mask controls how light or dark areas become transparent, allowing any image to be used as an independent mask by loading it in its own layer. Key allows chroma key transparency effects, such as green screen, to be applied to any layer. Hue allows a hue offset to be applied.
Added menu items to stop media conversion, force index and thumbnail regenerations, and improved feedback during the media conversion process.
Images and media which have an alpha channel now display correctly: the alpha channel controls image transparency properly.

=== Bug Fixes

Fixed problem with copying head data between groups using the keypad which was broken since 1.5.9.7.  Copying head data using head numbers was not affected.

Removed timeout on MagicHD media conversion. #7054, #6735.

=== New Functions

==== MQ60

Support for new graphics system as used on MagicQ PC for Windows, Mac and Linux and on the MagicQ Pro 2014 console.

This release includes an option to run both the new graphics system or the old graphics system.  The new graphics includes gradient shading and improved fonts.  The new graphics system refreshes the whole screen at the same time - this means that some operations will be smoother although sometimes they may take slightly longer.

It is possible to easily change between the graphics systems in the Setup Window, View System, View Status, SHIFT + Use New Graphics.  To change back to the original graphics, Setup Window, View System, View Status, SHIFT + Use Old Graphics.  Changing graphics will reset the system.

=== Bug Fixes

Fixed problem with stand alone MagicVis crashing on start up.

Fixed remote switch support which was broken in 1.6.0.9 to 1.6.1.1

Fixed problem with Autom Go to Cue ID and Jump which would not jump to the correct Cue Id.

Added divider option for Autom Go Cue Id = Level so that when using MIDI velocities, MIDI velocity 1 can be set to trigger Cue Id 1. #0007061

== Version 1.6.1.1

=== New Functions

==== MagicHD

MagicHD stand alone version for Mac with full 8 layers HD media playback capability is now included in the MagicQ for Mac installer.   This works in the same way as MagicHD stand alone for Windows.

MagicHD stand alone is fully unlocked when connected to a MagicQ console or MagicQ Wing system with encoder wheels.  When no MagicQ console or Wing system is detected on the network it supports only 1 layer.

==== Universe Naming

It is now possible to name each of the universes in Setup, View DMX I/O to help with organisation of the universes.  The universe name is shown in Patch, View Chans and the Outputs, View Chans windows.

==== Other Changes

View Palette soft button in the Position, Colour, Beam windows has been moved towards the left side in line with the MagicQ philosophy to have View buttons to the left and more dangerous buttons (such as Remove/Clear) to the right.

Execute Grids and Output Plans can now be named.


=== Bug Fixes

Fixed problem in 1.6.1.0 with the new View Heads window which could cause a reset. #0006987

Further fix for Patch offsets on start up when using a default Cue.  In the previous version the default value would be  set correctly but the move incorrectly when the first cue was activated.


== Version 1.6.1.0


=== New Functions

MagicQ Pro 2014 consoles now supports audio input through the phono connectors on the rear of the console.  Note that this requires the latest Pro 2014 kernel Mon Jan 20th.  In Setup, View Settings, Ports set Audio Input to Console Inbuilt Port.

Improved Group, View Heads view to show sub selected heads and to provide option of viewing All Heads or Selected Heads.

== Version 1.6.0.9

=== New Functions

==== MagicHD

MagicHD - stand alone version for Windows with full 8 layers HD media playback capability is now included in the MagicQ for Windows installer.  

MagicHD stand alone is fully unlocked when connected to a MagicQ console or MagicQ Wing system with encoder wheels.  When no MagicQ console or Wing system is detected on the network it supports only 1 layer.

MQ60 and MQ70 expanded number of universes

The MQ60 and MQ70 can now be used as "wing" systems for a PC or Mac running MagicQ software with up to 64 universes.  This enables large shows to be controlled with just a MQ60/70 and a laptop.

When the PC or Mac detects the MQ60/70 on the network it unlocks the remote control support on the PC or Mac allowing the MQ60/70 to be used to remote control MagicQ running on the PC or Mac.

If required the DMX output ports on the MQ60/70 can be used to output network universes from the PC / Mac.  Before entering remote control mode on the MQ60/70 configure  Universes 1 to 4 to input ArtNet/ACN/Pathport universes and set their Test Mode to "Input". This will loop the network universes received from the Mac/PC out of the direct ports on the MQ60/70.

==== Audio Support

MagicQ for Windows, Mac and Linux now supports audio input via the PC/Mac sound card.  In Setup, View Settings, Ports set Audio Input to PC/Mac sound card.  Audio support is enabled when the PC/Mac is connected to a MagicQ Wing or Interface (not MagicDMX).

==== Colour Window

Support for selection of colour mix mode in the Colour Widow to enable using the encoders to operate in CMY, RGB and HSI modes.  Colour chosen is also now shown on the CMY encoders.


=== Bug Fixes

Fix for 2nd monitor output on a Pro 2014 console - this was broken in recent releases.

Fix for multicast / ChamNet on MQ60 and MQ70.  Previously ChamNet devices might not be detected and multicast packets would not be correctly forwarded through the network switch on the MQ60/70.  Also ACN streaming DMX might not work correctly.   #0006014

Fixed problem on MagicQ consoles and Linux PC when removing playbacks or changing DMX addresses which could cause channels in Cues to be lost and potential resets   #0006183 

Fixed problem morphing from fixtures with just a colour wheel to 16bit CMY fixtures.

Fixed problem with serial automs where the serial stream could get parsed incorrectly.

=== Bug Fixes

Fix for using keyboards when remote controlling other MagicQ systems.  Since 1.5.9.2 MagicQ when remote controlling using Windows, Mac and Linux MagicQ PC builds would not support the keyboard correctly.  This only affected keyboard keys - button presses from MagicQ consoles and wings would work correctly.   #0006707, #0005460

Inbuilt bitmaps on Media page 1 of the Pixelmapper were not showing correctly on MQ60 and Pro 2010 consoles in recent betas. #0006780

Fix for occasional reset when opening Visualiser #0006760, #0006733

Fix for full screen view in Visualiser  #0006690

Fix for multi head elements such as Robe Robin 600 LED wash in Visualiser.  #006790

== Version 1.6.0.7

=== New Functions

==== Improvements to FX

The FX Engine has been improved to support easier selection of colour and Palette FX particularly when mixing CMY and RGB fixtures.
  
==== FX Selection

When FX are selected, they are now grouped into the categories - Intensity, Position, Colour, Beam, Any Attribute, User and Old.  All User FX are shown in the User category - only inbuilt FX are shown in the Intensity, Position, Colour and Beam categories.  Note that all FX are still stored in the FX folder as .wve files - they are just intelligently filtered into categories.

==== FX on CMY and RGB fixtures

The inbuilt colour FX are now designed to work on both CMY and RGB fixtures - these FX are set with the "Auto Invert RGB" option set in the Waveform FX.  This means that, for example, adding the RGB FX to a group of CMY and RGB fixtures will cause all fixtures to change colour red, green, blue.
 
==== FX using Palettes 

Palettes can be chosen when the FX is applied rather than having to create new Waveform FX.  Palette selection can be changed directly in the Programmer, View FX and Cue , View FX windows.  Changes of Palette selection are immediately updated in the Output.

The inbuilt library of FX contains several Waveform FX that allow selection of Palettes - including 2col, 3col, 4col, 2pos, 3pos, 4pos, 2iris and 2focus.  

For example, to make a FX that colour changes between yellow and magenta simply choose the 2col FX - then select the "Yellow" palette, followed by the "Magenta" palette.  Change the width parameter to vary the proportion of time spent on yellow and magenta.

Users can create their own waveform FX using the FX Editor.  To make a waveform FX that has selected palettes, set both the "Use Palettes" and  "Use FX Palettes" in the Edit FX, View General.  The palettes in Edit FX, View Chans are then Palette indices rather than Palette numbers - e.g. Col 1 refers to the first selected Palette when you apply the FX, Col 2 the second selected Palette.

==== FX colour flicks

MagicQ now supports colour flicks - i.e. FX that apply a different colour over the base colour without mixing the colours - for example running a red flick over a green base without mixing the red and green to get yellow.

The inbuilt FX library now includes Red, Green, Blue and White colour flicks.  In addition there is a colflick FX where you select the colour you want from a colour palette.  The width parameter can be modified to change the width of the flick.

Users can create their own Waveform FX to perform complex colour flicks.  In Edit FX, View General set the Default Add Type to "Abs".  In the Edit FX, View Chans set the curve to "Abs" for steps that you want to be absolute and to "Trans" for steps that you want to be transparent (i.e. not affected by the FX - just the base level).  The levels for steps set to "Trans" should be 0, or if using Palette based FX then just set them to the first Palette selection (P1,C1,B1). 

==== FX in old shows

Shows that use the older FX in their Cues will continue to use the old FX unless the FX are reloaded in the FX Editor using the Reload FX soft button.  New shows will use the new FX.

The older FX that are now superseded by better new FX are categorised in the Old folder.

==== Other FX changes

Absolute FX can now be faded in and out - previously they would snap.
The Width parameter is now part of the spreadsheet view in the Programmer Window, View FX and the Cue Window, View FX.
The legacy per FX, Fade In and Fade Out times have been removed from the View FX view of the Programmer Window.  Since 2010 FX Fade In and Fade Out times have been part of the Cue Step and are set in the View Times view of the Programmer Window.
Legacy shows that still use the per FX, Fade In and Fade Out times can still have these times edited (and removed) from View FX in the Cue Window.  Note that these columns have been moved to the end so you must page right to find them.

==== Morphing

It is now possible to morph between fixtures with inbuilt dimmers and fixtures with virtual dimmers.   For example it is possible to morph a RGB fixture with an inbuilt dimmer to a RGB fixture with a virtual dimmer.  It is also possible to morph back from a fixture with a virtual dimmer to one that has an inbuilt dimmer.
When morphing between fixtures with CMY/RGB and Colour Wheel to fixtures with only Colour Wheels, MagicQ now converts the CMY/RGB data to Col Wheel rather than trying to map between the Colour Wheels. This ensures that shows programmed with Cues using RGB palettes morph to Col Wheel palettes.

When morphing to heads with greater number of colour wheels or greater number of gobo wheels MagicQ now includes the extra colour or gobo wheels channels in Palettes and Cues where the colour wheels or gobo wheels were previously used.  This enables easy updating of shows, for example when changing from fixtures with only 1 gobo wheel to fixtures with 2 gobo wheels.

==== Other changes

It is now possible to make heads that automatically patch a virtual dimmer.  In the Head Editor, View General, Options there is an option "Virtual Dim".  If this is set to "yes" and the head has no dimmer then a virtual dimmer is automatically patched for this head.  A new Virtual Dimmer version of LED3chan has been added to the library.  Note that Virtual Dimmer is distinct from Virtual Channels where all the channels of the head have separate DMX addresses.

Support has been added for dimmer curves on 16bit dimmer attributes.  The inbuilt dimmer curves s-law and inverse s law now work on 16bit dimmer attributes.  User dimmer curves can now specify 16bit values (0..66535) instead of just (0..255).  If any value in the user dimmer curve file is over 255 then 16bit is assumed.

Additional Tap to Time playback options have been added to Setup, View Settings, Playback, Tap to Time buttons.  These include holding S button and pressing GO and holding S button and pressing FLASH.

==== New Execute Window and iOS app

The Execute Window has been improved to support improved images of buttons, faders and encoders.  These can be selected in Execute Window, View Design by selecting Images on soft button B.

The Execute Window now supports encoders for speed control of Cue Stacks.  Use Insert Special, and select Encoder to insert an encoder below a recorded Cue Stack.  The Encoder will only be active when the Cue Stack above is active.

The Execute Window supports custom images for the buttons, faders and encoders.  The images should be stored in the bitmaps folder and named according to:

Button up image		xxxxup.bmp
Button down image		xxxxdn.bmp
Fader track image		xxxxtrck.bmp
Fader knob image		xxxxknob.bmp
Encoder back image		xxxxbase.bmp
Encoder dial image		xxxxdial.bmp

Where xxxx is any name.  The images can be bmp, jpeg or png.  The bitmaps can be selected for each item in the Execute Window, View Design by pressing the BUTTON BITMAP soft button.

This version also supports an improved iOS app which allows the Execute Window images to be shown on your iPhone or  iPad as images instead of boxes.  Custom button images will be automatically downloaded to the iOS app.

The iOS app now supports an Idiot user mode which forces the iOS app always to run in full Execute Window.  This is set up in MagicQ app settings in the iOS settings menu.  A particular console IP address can also be specified to ensure the iOS always connects to the correct console.

The new version of the iOS app will be on the App Store soon.

Head numbers have now been expanded so that all Versions support numbers up to 32768 regardless of the number of universes the console is set to.  Note that loading shows with higher head numbers into older versions of software will cause those head numbers to be reduced to the limit of that console/software. #0005984
 
=== Bug Fixes

Performance of user interface on Pro 2014 in recent betas was seriously affected when the Output and Output Info windows were open.   This was particularly bad when these windows were placed at full size on external monitors.

== Version 1.5.9.4

=== New Functions

==== Multi Console Simplifications

The use of multiple MagicQ consoles in a network has been made much simpler by the introduction of the concept of Network Sessions:

*	A MagicQ console is made part of a network session by simply setting the Net Session Mode and choosing a Net Session ID.

*	Within a network session only one MagicQ console is the Master, all others are Slaves to the Master console.  Only the Master console outputs universes (ArtNet/ACN/Pathport) on the network. 

*	All Slaves in the network session are automatically synchronised to the show file from the Master console.

*	All Slaves in the network session can take control of part of the Output via the multi channel control feature.

*	All Slaves in the network session can edit show data including Palettes, Cues and Cue Stacks on the Master console (note this feature is not available in the US).

*	All Slaves in the network session are automatically synchronised to the playback state of the Master console.  Each Slave can choose to Inhibit PB Sync, for example whilst programming.

*	It is possible at any time to change which console is the Master console by using the  Take Control feature from the Slave console. 

*	The Net Session Mode can be set to Sync Auto Takeover or Sync Manual Takeover when set to Sync Auto Takeover if the Master console fails then a Slave will automatically take over.  In Sync Manual Takeover the user must manually use Take Control.

*	It is possible to inhibit all network output from the consoles in the network session using the Inhibit All feature.  All consoles outputs within the network session are disabled.  It is still possible to change Master but the outputs remain disabled. 


It is now no longer needed to set the Show Data Sync Type and the Show Data Sync IP MagicQ sets this automatically within the network session.

It is now no longer needed to set the Playback Sync Type and the Playback Sync IP MagicQ sets this automatically within the network session.

It is now no longer needed to set the Hot Takeover mode MagicQ sets this automatically according to the Net Session Mode.


==== Configuration Simplifications

The Network option MultiWindows is now no longer required and has been removed. MagicQ for Windows, Mac and Linux and MagicQ Pro 2014, Pro 2010 and Compact consoles all have inbuilt multi windowing support.  If you wish to use network based multi windows on a separate PC together with a MagicQ then set Enable remote access = yes. 

The Setup option Force Window On External Monitor is now fully supported on Windows, Linux, Mac and consoles with external monitors.  It forces a window onto the 2nd monitor. Previously it was only supported on older Pro consoles.

Wing configuration in Setup, View System Wings is now simplified by all wings defaulting to Playback/Extra Wing.  This enables plug'n'play with one or more Playback or Extra wings.

The Artistic License parallel port interface is no longer supported as modern PCs do not have parallel ports.


==== Other Changes

Icons are now always enabled - with options now being Small, Large and Large when no name.  This last option enables mixing of small and large icons dependent on whether a name is set for an item.

Icons can now be set directly in the Execute Window.  For Cues and Cues Stacks the icons are propagated through to the Cues in the Cue Store and the Cues Stacks in the Stack Store.

The support for a single external monitor interface on old Pro consoles using the network connected video card has now been removed as the resolutions supported were not sufficient for modern monitors.  Full external monitor support at resolutions up to 1920x1200 are available via upgrade to Pro 2014.

Audio and MIDI status are now shown in the status box on Compact series products.

Support for updating firmware on SnakeSys R8.


=== Bug Fixes

The calibrate window was not showing on external monitors on the Pro 2014.

Fixed problem on Mac version with loading of head names for patched heads - they were not loaded correctly. #5512 #5908 #5685

In recent betas 1.5.8.x to 1.5.9.3 there was a problem with IMPORT SHOW. As soon as you went to choose a new fixture the software would become unstable. #5838

The FX Edit Window did not allow FX to be edited correctly in recent versions  #5787 

Tap to time on S buttons only affected the first FX in Cues with multiple FX. #5760

The Set box and Quick macros are now disabled when the console is locked.

Fix to graphics in Media Window on Pro 2014 consoles when showing previews in the preview boxs. #5728

In the Media Window, the wrong preview for some media server types with ranges set for the media folder. #5719

Support for changing firmware on MQ40 (was disabled in 1.5.9.2).

Displaying of thumbnails and .jpg images in MagicQ on Windows was broken in recent betas #5759 #4764 #5523 #5892

When using multi head elements with a main element with a dimmer and multi elements with RGB or RGBA then selecting the all group and setting @ FULL would cause all the RGB or RGBA to go to white.

On Pro 2014 all windows were opened on start up #5706

Fixed problem with external window support on PC (Windows, Linux, Mac) versions to keep focus correctly. #5714 #5723

The Pixelmapper used the wrong grid when the Output Info window was open #4874

Improved the response of the touch screen on Pro 2014 when the Output Window was open.

== Version 1.5.9.2

=== New Functions

Support for MQ40 console.

=== Bug Fixes

Fixed problem with Manual Crossfading using dual crossfading on PB9 and PB10 whereby intensity channels fading out would be faded out when the fade in was complete even when the fade out was not complete.

Fixed problem with retrieving thumbs in 1.5.9.1 - it could cause consoles to reset. #5620

Fixed problem with loading from USB stick on a Pro 2014 console - it did not enable immediate saving to USB stick.

Improved external window support on PC (Windows, Linux, Mac) versions to only include a single window banner and to keep focus correctly.

Fixed support for USB mice on Pro 2014 consoles.


== Version 1.5.9.1

=== New Functions

Added reporting of memory usage on MagicQ consoles - see Setup, View System, View Status, System, Memory Usage..

Added support for one shot FX.  Two new library waveform FX have been added - PulseOne and RampOne.  Custom waveform FX can be created and set as one shot in the FX parameters.

Modified the size on screen of the simulated Magic Wand.


=== Bug Fixes

Fixed problem with memory usage when using large movie files (e.g. 100x100 pixels and above) on the Pixel Mapper - if lots of movies were loaded then the system could run out of memory causing unexpected lock ups and crashes.  This was caused by the system allocating much more memory than was required for each movie clip.

Fixed problem with changing the DMX address of heads and morphing heads in shows.  It  was possible for Cues to get corrupted such that they contained a channel more than once - then when moving or morphing channels that were used in those Cues could leave erroneous values in Cues.
 
Fixed problem with loading media server personalities on the MQ60 - MagicQ would display an error indicating that the multi element personality could not be found.  Recreating the head index in the File Manager worked around the problem.

Fixed problem with using user dimmer curves on the MQ60 - they would always be set to a step.

== Version 1.5.8.9

=== New Functions

Added support in Setup, View System, View Status for a counter of the number of times the remote input has been switched since the system was started.

=== Bug Fixes

Fixed problem with the FX size update function in the Cue Window - it would set all attributes and parameters of a FX to the same size rather than setting up the sizes according to the individual attributes.

Fixed problem with MagicQ for Linux 1.5.8.6 and 1.5.8.7 when installed on Linux systems with a Locale such as France that uses a "," instead of a "." for representing a floating point number. #0005445.

Fixed problem with installing new software versions if users had replaced the demo movie files with custom content - the custom content would be overwritten with the demo files.

Fixed problem in v1.5.8.7 with fixtures with a "." in the name - it would not load them correctly.

Fixed problem in v1.5.8.7 with recreating head index when adding a new fixture.
Version 1.5.8.7

=== New Functions

==== MQ60

Improved performance of patching and scrolling of windows on MagicQ MQ60.

Added external USB touch screen support for MQ60s.


==== Visualiser

Improved the mouse navigation.  Added support for Zoom.  On Windows hold CTRL, hold the right mouse button and move the mouse up or down.  On Mac hold SHIFT and use the scroll wheel. 

==== Net Manager

Support in Net Manager for latest SnakeSys B4 with inbuilt FLASH memory (units with last 4 digits of serial number greater than 0268).

Full support in Net Manager for SnakeSys T2 and SnakeSys R8.

==== Magic Wand

Added support for a simulated Magic Wand - start MagicQ with the command line argument "wand".  MagicQ will run just a simulation of the Magic Wand controlling the first 4 playbacks from the first Wing.

If you wish to restrict the Wand simulation to only connect to a specific IP address then include the required IP address as the second command line argument of the IP address.

==== Other Changes

Added sensitivity option for when using pan/tilt controlled by mouse/track ball.

=== Bug Fixes

Fixed problem with using ChamSys Dual DMX interfaces on Windows/Linux and Version 1.5.8.6.  This only affected beta version 1.5.8.6.

Fixed problem in Pixel Mapper in MagicQ for Windows whereby when swapping between different icon bitmaps the Cue Engine could stop working (this would cause wing disconnects and DMX to stop).  It only occurred when changing between different icon bitmaps.  It would not occur when changing between for example, an icon and a movie. 

Fixed problem in Pixel Mapper whereby sometimes when changing back to an inbuilt bitmap (for example when pressing Locate) the output would remain showing a timer bitmap rather than the requested inbuilt bitmap.  Changing to a different inbuilt bitmap (for example, not the cross) would refresh the output correctly.

Fixed problem with MagicQ on Mac whereby objects such as trusses and pipes would not show up in the visualiser.

Fixed problem when changing Layout views with large Cue Stacks - the view would change back to the start even if the Follow Cue option was selected. #0004750

Fixed problem in MagicQ inc Vis when recording macros #0005078.

Fixed problem when setting value for RGB fixtures #0005069.

Fixed problem with Cue tracking and Remoe FX. #0005266.

Fixed Erase Console on MQ60 and Pro 2014 consoles.  Performing an Erase Console on v1.5.8.6 or before on these consoles would cause the MagicQ file structure to be corrupted.  This could be fixed in file Manager by going up directory to the top level and creating a MagicQ folder and then loading on v.15.8.6 from USB stick.

Fixed problem on Pro 2014 consoles when using external monitors with different resolutions - the offsets would be incorrect.

Fixed PS2 mouse support on Pro 2014 consoles.

Added improved debugging support to MQ60 and Pro 2014 build.


== Version 1.5.8.6

=== New Functions

Updated MagicQ Media Centre to support 64 Universes.  Added support for converting larger movies to cmv files - up to 100,000 pixels - previously there was a maximum of 10,000 pixels.

Added pan and tilt invert to the personality files so that it is now possible for MagicVis to model the real fixture pan and tilt direction.

Added movement damping to MagicVis to simulate movement times of real fixtures.

Modified Generic Camera personality for MagicVis to use 16bit values.

The Windows, Linux and Mac versions of MagicQ now use the new improved graphical toolkit and include the visualiser.  The older MagicQ app has now been replaced with MagicQ inc Vis.


=== Bug Fixes

Added a fix for Pro 2010 consoles for reported DMX loss problem. #0005178, #0005208

Fixed a few problems with the use of 64 universes.  It was not possible to re patch heads above Universe 40.

Fixed a reset problem if head numbers were inadvertently set above the head number limit of 32768.


== Version 1.5.8.5

=== New Functions

=== Bug Fixes

Fix problem when using many intensity / group masters.  A reset could be caused on MagicQ consoles when changing fader levels in shows with large numbers of intensity / group masters.

== Version 1.5.8.4

Support for external multi windows on Pro 2010 consoles enabling a total of up to 4 external monitors - 2 direct from console, 2 on external PCs.

Improved firmware upgrade procedure.


=== Bug Fixes

Media Window and bitmaps showed wrong colour in MagicQ inc Vis.  #0004762

Soft keys don't update properly in MagicQ inc Vis. #0005051

Saving heads in Head Editor stops IPC programming until MagicQ is restarted #0005081

Automation Window and serial communication did not work correctly.  #0004547

== Version 1.5.8.1

=== New Functions

Added support for patching direct to a specific head number using the * operator.

For example:

10 @ 7 - 2 * 201

This will patch 10 heads at channel 2 on Universe 7 starting at head number 201.

Added support for an extra level of playback priority Mid priority.

Added support for fader images in the Execute Window - the track part should end trck and the knob part should end knob - e.g. fadertrck.jpg and faderknob.jpg.

Improvements to faders and encoders on MagicQ inc Vis.

=== Bug Fixes

Fixed problem on the MQ60 with changing DMX output type that could cause a reset or loss of front panel communications.

Fixed problem on the MQ60 where it would take a long time to shut down and turn off.


== Version 1.5.7.9

=== New Functions

=== Bug Fixes

Fix problem with Highlight in 1.5.7.7 and 1.5.7.8. #0004925

Fix problem with more than 10 Grids.  #0004927

Support for confirm boxes on external screens on MagicQ consoles.


=== Bug Fixes

Fixed problem with layouts using multiple screens on remote tablets.

Fixed problem with patch offsets when using 16 bit channels.  Channels activated in the programmer would get slightly incorrect values.


== Version 1.5.7.6

=== New Functions

==== Blind Visualisation

MagicQ now supports Blind Visualisation and Preview Visualisation when used together with MagicVis, Capture or WYSIWYG.  This enables a Visualiser to show the contents of the Programmer during BLIND mode or to preview a Playback that is not active on the real outputs.

In Patch, View Vis press the VIS SOURCE Soft button to choose between visualising the console Output, the BLIND programmer, the selected Playback, or the next step on the selected Playback.

When set to Blind Programmer MagicQ will add the contents of the Programmer to the Output visualisation even when the programmer is in BLIND mode.

When set to Playback MagicQ will show in the visualiser the contents of the selected Playback as if the Playback fader was at 100%.  Only data from the selected Playback is shown.

When set to Next GO MagicQ will show in the visualiser the output of the console as it would appear if GO was pressed on the selected Playback.  When the selected Playback has multiple steps then MagicQ always shows the next step in the Visualiser.  If the selected Playback is not active then MagicQ will show what would occur if the Playback was activated.

Blind Visualisation and Preview Visualisation do not affect the normal network outputs such as ArtNet, ACN, or Pathport.  Only the DMX stream sent directly to the Visualiser is affected.

When using Capture visualisation, Capture must be connected via CITP universes rather than ArtNet - otherwise Capture will just show the console output.

==== Multi element heads

Multi element heads that consist of a main element and a repeated element - i.e. heads with the Before or After option set are now stored together in one head file.  This makes the heads easier to transport between consoles.  The Head Editor now shows the full channel list in View Chans including the repeated channels.

=== Bug Fixes

Fixed problem with layouts using multiple screens on remote tablets.

Fixed problem with manual crossfade and 16 bit dimmers. #0004719.

== Version 1.5.7.5

=== New Functions

Improved the inbuilt web server so that when using it to remote control a console the remote keypad sizes better to web browsers on remote devices.  Selection the Web type to Enabled CSS to use the new style sheet based remote keypad.

==== MagicVis improvements

MagicVis now supports multi element heads - in Patch, View Vis they will appear as a single head so they can be moved and rotated as a single element, but in MagicVis they will appear with all the elements.

==== MagicQ inc Vis improvements

MagicQ inc Vis now supports all the features of MagicQ.

MagicQ inc Vis on Mac now supports MagicQ Wings and Interfaces.  It also supports Gel colours.

Full support for pixel mapping including cmv movies.

Full support for media server thumbnails and previews.

Full support for multi console operation including grab show.

Support for Multi Windows on the same system - on both Windows and Mac versions.

Support for initial splash screen.

Support for ChamNet protocols and all other multicast protocols.

Support for inbuilt web server.

Improved the refresh of the Windows, particularly the Output and Media Windows.

MagicQ now stores the visualiser window position separately to the main settings - Setup, View System, Monitors now handles multi windows as per the old MagicQ.

Please inform ChamSys via the Bugtracker of any functions that do not work correctly in MagicQ inc Vis.


=== Bug Fixes

Capture and CITP connection - inversed data after inverting pan and tilt #0001614.

Theatre patch mode.  After adding a head on multiple DMX addresses the extra DMX channels were not immediately updated.  #0004608

== Version 1.5.7.4

=== New Functions

==== Multi Element Heads

Improved the support for moving lights with multiple elements such as Robe 600 LED Wash.  The All Group now includes both the main and the repeated elements.  This group can be used to treat the multi elements all as a single head.  

MagicQ now allows FX to be applied to a group of heads even if some of those heads do not have the required attributes - for example when a multi element head has pan and tilt in the main part and colour in the repeated elements.  This allows each of the FX to be added from the All group instead of requiring the main and repeated groups to be selected separately.

Using LOCATE on the All Group locates all the elements in the head.

It is now possible to sub select one of the elements using the dot operator.  To sub select the 2nd element of a multi element head enter

. 2 NEXT HEAD

In Theatre/Hog modes where the keypad is set to select heads simple enter

. 2

To get back the complete selection press ALL.

MagicQ also creates a Mn Group - with only the main part of the head and a Ele Group with the repeated elements.


==== Other Changes

Added new options for how box style windows are shown on external monitors.  This enables the sizing (number of columns) on the external monitors to be the same as on the internal touch screen.  In Setup, View Settings, Windows, Force Window on External Monitor you can choose the additional options Normal same res and Normal 10 cols. 

Added ability to update the size of all Cues with a specific FX type on a set of heads.  In the Cue Window, View FX put the cursor on the size field and press SHIFT + UPDATE ALL to update all Cues that have the same FX on the same heads.

Cue Stack now marks time code steps where the time code is out of order with a *.

When pinging from MagicQ, using ... without an address will ping the address from the last ping attempt.

Improved the display of patch offsets in the Outputs Window so they are only highlighted in green when they are not active on a playback.


=== Bug Fixes

Fixed problem with inserting a Mark Cue after Cues set to Timecode - the Mark Cue would be incorrectly set to timecode value 0 causing the Cue Stack to work incorrectly.

Corrected protocol issues in CITP/MSEX which stopped some media servers such as Madrix being able to send thumbnails. #0003966

Output Window title bar now shows when it is in Input mode. #000647

Remote control from a system with a higher screen resolution than the console would cause screen painting issues on the remote system.  #0004242.

It was not possible to move or copy Cue Stacks from the Stack Store to a playback with a default cue. #0004597

	When a FX is used in a cue, and the same FX is used with the same parameters except for size in the next cue, the parameters changes in that last cue were not applied.  #0004527

There was a naming error in the Head Editor, Multi Element, Order options.  The first "Bottom right to Top Snake" was actually "Bottom right to left snake". #0004621

If you updated the current Cue in a Cue Stack with Move When Dark enabled then the current Cue would be re-output without the move when dark. #0004560

Removing an attribute from a head in the Head Editor could result in the removal of more than one attribute if multiple columns were cursor selected. #0000274

There was a possible reset when removing Cues from the end of a Cue Stack when the Cue Stack was active with the current Cue as the last or previous to last Cue.  #0003658

Fixed problem with remote controlling a MagicQ from another MagicQ system.  When using the UPDATE function the remote system would not show the state of the update options correctly.

Fixed problem with using the UPDATE function - once Patch Offset was selected then it was not possible to clear this option.

== Version 1.5.7.3

=== Bug Fixes

Fixed problem with Width parameter in FX - in version 1.5.7.2 it would always do a width of 50%.  #0004492

Added support for ArtNet sequence field.  This is now enabled by default but can be disabled from Setup, View Settings, Hardware, Reduced Rate DMX, No Seq if required.  #000946

Robe demo show, 2nd page of pixel map Cue Stacks did not work in 1.5.7.2.

Odd / Even did not work for LEDs with virtual dimmers.  #0003940

== Version 1.5.7.2

=== Bug Fixes

Fixed problem in the Grid View in recent betas that caused a reset - affected grids with fixtures with no CMY or RGB attributes.  This problem also caused VDIM channels not to show in the Grid correctly.  #0004445, #0003706.
 
Fixed problem with Update only method of updating.  When selecting Cue Stacks rather than Palettes MagicQ would update the Cues in the Cue Stack with the values from the programmer but would incorrectly maintain links to the original Palettes.  If those Palettes were then updated the original Cues would be updated again.

Fixed FX Engine so that random FX changes all attributes of the FX at the same time. Also fixed Flicker UP, Flicker Down and Flicker Sync FX which were not working correctly.  #0000674.

Fixed problem with gel icons in MagicQ inc Vis - red and blue colours were swapped. #0004449.

Fixed problem when using Cue Stack window with Display Current Cue option.  Changing selected playback jumped the window back to the first cue in the Stack not to the current Cue. #0004301

Fixed problem with loading set lists.  If the page names had spaces in them then it would not work correctly.  #0001209, #0004260
Version 1.5.7.1

=== New Functions

==== MagicQ Visualiser

MagicQ software now supports a visualiser to enable pre programming of lighting.  It also provides a useful learning/training tool.

The Visualiser is available in two variants; a MagicVis application for connecting via network  to a MagicQ console, and a combined MagicQ/Visualiser version for use on a single PC or Mac.

The Visualiser is available for both Windows and Mac. A linux version will be available in the near future.

On Windows, click on Start, Programs, ChamSys MagicQ PC, MagicVis for the network app and Start, Programs, ChamSys MagicQ PC, MagicQ (inc Vis) for the combined version.

On Mac, click on the Applications, MagicQ, MagicQincVis for the network app and Applications, MagicQ, MagicQincVis for the combined version.

The combined version of MagicQ and Visualiser has a VIS button in the top right hand corner of the screen.  Press the VIS button to open the visualisation window.  Press the VIS button again to close the visualisation window.

The performance of the visualisation will depend on the graphics capability of the PC or Mac that the visualisation is running on and the number of fixtures you are trying to visualise.  For our demo shows with moving lights and pixel mapping we recommend at least a NVIDIA GeForce 9600M GT.

==== Fanning attributes and times by segments and groups

The fan toolbar has been enhanced to add support for fanning by segments and by groups.

When fanning by segments is selected then adjacent heads are adjusted by the same amount - e.g. when segments are set to 2 the fan occurs with pairs of adjacent heads having the same adjustment.

When fanning by groups, the fan is performed on each group in turn as if the group contained  the only selected heads.  This enables a fan to be simultaneously applied to groups of different sizes.

Fanning by segments overrides fanning by parts.  Fanning by groups overrides fanning by parts or segments.

Fanning by segments and groups can be used on attributes values, and on times in the Programmer, View Times, Simple view and Cue, View Times, Simple View.

In order to maintain compatibility with older versions and remote control, the new functions have been added to the existing fan tool bar.  Direct selection of fanning using 4 parts and 5 parts now can be done by typing 4 or 5 followed by the N parts fan.

Moving of Cues and Cue Stacks in the Cue Store and Stack Store

It is now possible to move Cues within the Cue Store and Stacks within the Stack Store even when they have been assigned to Stacks and Playbacks.

A Cue can be moved in the Cue Store as long as the Cue is not active in the Cue Store and none of the Cue Stacks that uses the Cue are active (on Playbacks, Execute or Stack Store).

A Cue Stacks can be moved in the Stack Store as long as the Cue Stack is not active (on Playbacks, Execute or Stack Store).

==== Other Changes

Support for Active FX whilst holding FX, press SET.

Moving Palettes entries in the Palette Window, Cues in the Cue Store and Stacks in the Stack Store now updates the links to these items in the Execute Window.  Previously the links would be lost and the Execute Window would no longer work as expected.


=== Bug Fixes

Fixed problem when using patch offsets.  After startup / reset the first time the heads were activated in the programmer the values would jump to an incorrect value.

When recording palettes, MagicQ now avoids making links to other palettes for pan and tilt if either the pan or tilt attribute has been modified.


== Version 1.5.7.0

=== New Functions

==== Programmer Master

It is now possible to make a Playback into a Programmer Master.  Record an empty Cue onto a Playback and then set the Cue Stack option, Function, Programmer Master.

When the Playback is activated by pressing the GO button then the fader level becomes the Programmer level.  Releasing the fader level causes the Programmer level to go back to 100%.

When the fader is less set to less than 100%, the FLASH button can be used to bump in the Programmer at 100%.

The GO button and BACK buttons are used to swap Palette values in the Programmer when the Programmer has mixed palette values.

For instance if some heads are set to use the RED palette in the programmer and others using the GREEN palette then pressing GO will swap all the heads using RED palette to use GREEN and all the heads using GREEN palette to use RED.

If there are more than 2 colour Palettes in use in the Programmer, then the colours rotate around all the different Palettes.

Odd/Even can be used to easily set up an initial look of 2 or more colour palettes.

Currently only one Programmer Master can be active at a time.


==== FX based on chosen colour

It is now possible to create FX based on any chosen colour rather than just primary colours - a new example Colpulse.wve is included as part of the standard FX library.

When the FX is created, the base level of the colour channel will be used to determine the colour that the FX will use.  When the FX is played back the base level is used in the FX itself rather than the FX adding to the base.

To create a new FX based on base colour, in the FX Edit Window, View General, set Use Col Base = Yes.

==== Other Changes

Improved Auto Palettes to avoid overlapping Palettes for heads with similar gobo names such as Gobo 1, Gobo 2.  Also avoid creating Gobo Palettes for shaking and indexing gobos.

When new Colour Palettes are recorded, now a colour icon of the appropriate colour is auto assigned.

When new Beam Palettes are recorded, if the Beam includes a Gobo from Gobo Wheel 1, 2 or 3 then the appropriate gobo icon is auto assigned.


==== Bug Fixes

Fixed problem in 1.5.6.9 with display of fixtures without CMY in the Outputs View Plan View.


== Version 1.5.6.9

=== New Functions

The Media Window now supports more than 8 media servers - page through the media servers using the Server Bank soft button.  The Preview Layer / Output button has been moved to a SHIFT function.

It is now possible to change page quickly in the Playback Window by entering a number and pressing the top left soft button.

Support for remote trigger on ChamSys Remote protocol - send 71,<state>H where state is 0 or 1 for the remote trigger state.

Support for audio divider on Cue Stacks with the audio option Bumps GO.  Audio parameter 1 is used as a divider - set it between 2 and 10 to divide the received beat frequency by a value between 2 and 10 times.

Support for subtracting group by pressing minus before you select a group in the Group Window.

=== Bug Fixes

Fixed problem in recent betas with display of fixtures with virtual dimmers in the Outputs View Plan View - the fixtures would always show at full in the Grid.

When changing page the Cue Window is now unlocked to show the Cue for the currently selected playback on the new page.

When the Cue Stack Window is set to follow the current Cue it is now possible to move up and down the Cue Stack.

Fixed playback when using timecode, so that if the timecode is just stepping to the next step in the Cue Stack then it does not recalculate the entire state.

Fixed problem when paging right in Programmer Window when it was empty, which would cause a reset.

Fixed problem in MagicQ when editing head macros - removing a head macro could cause a reset.

Fixed problem when updating Cues in a tracking Cue Stack using the Update method.  When moving back up the Cue Stack, or jumping around then pressing Update would not show Palettes for attributes that tracked from earlier Cues.

Fixed problem with mark cues as the first step on Cue Stacks which activated on Page Change.  The mark cue would not run correctly.  This could be worked around by inerting a 0 second empty cue as the first Cue.

Fixed problem with remote control from MagicQ Windows to a MagicQ console whereby the RETURN key would sometimes be processed twice - this could cause head selection not to work as expected.

Tapping time on S buttons would only affect the first FX in the Cue.  #0004192

== Version 1.5.6.7

=== New Functions

Output Window, View Plan now has an option to show intensity values as well as head numbers.  Hold SHIFT and press VIEW HD+INT.

=== Bug Fixes

Fixed problem when morphing heads from heads with multiple elements to heads with duplicated elements such as Robe Robin 600 LED Wash mode 5 duplicated. The morphing would not work correctly with data not being transferred to the new heads.

Fixed problem when morphing heads from heads with multiple elements and a main section to heads with a single element.   The data for the multiple elements would be copied correctly, but the data from the main section would not be copied.  For example when converting from a Robe Robin 600 LED Wash mode 5 to a Robe Robin 600 LED Wash mode 2.

Shift Include no longer showed the SELECTED HEADS option.

Hot takeover and multi console control had problems in recent betas.

Wall paper did not show up in Execute Window.  #0004124

In 1.5.6.4 after editing and saving a head MagicQ continued to indicate that you would lose the edits.  #004088.

Auto group could give strange results.   #0004113.

Wait time display was not correct when delay times in use.  #0004117.

== Version 1.5.6.4

=== Bug Fixes

Fixed problem in 1.5.6.2 whereby MagicQ could crash on start up when creating the head index file.  1.5.6.2 would not work at all on Macs due to this problem.

Hot takeover was broken in recent betas when using Equal or Split mode.

Changing Capture make or name in the Head Editor caused an immediate regeneration of the head index. #0004036

Using Encoder Y to change Media Bank in the Pixel Mapper showed incorrect range names - hence an incorrect Media Bank could be selected with media clips frozen.  #003987


== Version 1.5.6.2

=== New Functions

==== Timecode Simulator

MagicQ now includes a powerful timecode simulator for simulating external timecode when an external timecode source is not available.  In the Setup Window, the simulator is turned on using soft button Y.  When the simulator is on, then any received external timecode is ignored.  

The timecode start value can be set by entering a timecode value and pressing the X soft button.  The X soft button is also used to start and stop the timecode running.  

Entering a new timecode value whilst the timecode simulator is running will jump directly to the new value and continue running. 

Typing * before pressing the X button will restart from the last entered timecode.


==== Macro Segments

Macros now support fader moves and encoder changes as well as button presses.  This enables complete recording and playback of macro segments.  Macro timing and playback now uses a higher resolution internal clock enabling accurate playback of recorded sequences.

MagicQ optimises fader moves to remove redundant steps.

It is now possible to move steps in the Macro, View Data view press MOVE and then select the source followed by the destination.  Multiple steps can be moved using SHIFT and the cursor keys.

The macro data can be reordered if the times have been changed out of sequence using the REORDER soft button.

The number of macros has been increased to 500.


==== MagicQ Automation

MagicQ supports an automation system to enable it to automatically respond to both external, internal and timed events.  MagicQ can trigger on external events such as MIDI notes, DMX input, serial input, timecode, and the remote contact input.  MagicQ can also trigger on internal events such as system startup, system shutdown and system powerfail.  In addition MagicQ can trigger on timed (scheduled) events.

MagicQ now supports an Automation Window for managing all of the automated events.  The Automation Window supports multiple events with each event being subject to specified parameters.  

Each event then triggers a particular MagicQ function this can be a function on a Playback, a Cue Stack, a Cue, a Page, a Macro or a Layout.

MagicQ can take a parameter from the event trigger and pass it to the function for example, it could take the velocity from a MIDI note event and tigger a Playback level using that velocity.

Events

* Scheduled
* MIDI note
* MIDI sysex
* Timecode
* Remote
* DMX input
* Serial port
* Startup
* Shutdown
* Power fail

Functions

* PB a,r,level
* PB level
* PB activate
* PB release
* PB act FULL
* PB go
* PB back
* PB ffwd
* PB fbck
* PB jump
* Stack activate
* Stack release
* Stack level
* Cue activate
* Cue release
* Cue level
* Run macro
* Change layout
* Change page
* Change page release main
* Change page release all


==== Show file name auto increment

MagicQ now supports auto incrementing show file names.  To start an auto incrementing show file, save a show file with the last part of the name set as _001.  When you next press SAVE SHOW, MagicQ will suggest saving to _002.  Press ENTER to accept, or edit the name to save to a different name.

Note that in order to avoid accidentally saving to incrementing files, all 3 digits must be present - _1 or _10 is not supported.  When the number _999 is reached MagicQ will not auto increment and will request a new name.

Please note that over use of the auto increment feature will lead to high disk usage.  It is important to clear out old versions once the show is finished.

To delete all old revisions of the current show file, go to File Manager, and press SHIFT and REMOVE OLD REVS.  This will remove all revisions of the current show file that have a lower revision number.  It will not remove the current show file.

==== Enabling / Disabling Zones from Cue Stack Macros

It is now possible to enable and disable zones (groups of Universes configured in Setup, View DMX I/O, page right) using Cue Stack Macros.  To enable a zone use the macro H5 and to disable a zone user the macro H6.  For example to enable zone 2.

H5/2

To disable zone 2:

H6/2


==== Other Changes

Modified behaviour of Swap mode and Execute Window.  Cue Stacks activated from the Execute Window (or Stack Store Window) now operate as if faders have been put to 100% rather than flash buttons.  Cue Stacks activated from the Execute Window will not cause other playbacks to swap unless they are set as Flash always swaps.   ###0001473

Support for include of just the FX from a Playback using SHIFT + INCLUDE.

Added extra protection to try to avoid losing settings if the console disc experiences a complete power off or reset from the white button.


=== Bug Fixes

Fixed problem with reassertion of FX in playbacks.

Macro 100 was not working. #0003917.

Fixed problem with Cue timing when using Mini Wing.  On some systems the system tick rate would be half the required rate causing fade times to take twice as long. #0000702, #0003620, #0003864
 
Fixed problem with Grab show in versions 1.5.6.0 and 1.5.6.1

Fixed problem with using the Edimax USB Wifi interface on MagicQ Pro 2010 consoles - this was broken in v1.5.4.0 to 1.5.6.0.  Requires kernel to be upgraded to kernel 3.9.2.0 - this is included as part of 1.5.6.2.  Setup, View System, View Status, Change Software and then select the number associated with kernel3.9.2.0.

Fixed problem when sending patch from Capture to MagicQ. #0003914

Fixed problem with copying groups to Playbacks.  #0003828.



== Version 1.5.6.1

=== New Functions

Added new Cue Stack Macro command 4H to kill the screen save function.  If the screen saver is currently active then the screen will be restored.  The screen save timer will be restarted.


=== Bug Fixes

Fixed several major problems with recent betas since 1.5.4.0.  We do not recommend you use betas 1.5.4.1, 1.5.4.2, 1.5.4.4 or 1.5.6.0 for live shows.

Fixed problem that could make newly created Palettes work incorrectly, with all attributes from the palettes outputting 0 value.

Fixed problem with colour picker on MagicQ consoles.

Fixed problem with using FX which caused a reset.  Mostly affected FX that can be applied to any attribute, but could also affect other FX.

Fixed problem with multi console control - this did not work in 1.5.6.0.

Fixed problem with importing palettes that could cause cues using the palettes to go to all zero values.

Fixed problems in MagicQ PC / Mac versions when using the on screen faders.  If the mouse was moved outside the fader area then the wrong fader was changed.


== Version 1.5.6.0

=== New Functions

==== Item Selection

It is now possible to cursor select multiple Window items that are not adjacent using the CTRL key.  This can be used for naming items and copying items.

In box style windows (e.g. Group, Pos, Col, Beam) it is also possible to remove and move items in this way.


==== Virtual Dimmers

Virtual dimmers now take effect at the Patch level rather than at the Programmer level.  This means that the Output Window, View Heads will show the virtual levels on the RGB channels (i.e. the RGB levels before the virtual dimmer is applied).  

The Outputs Window, View Chans, View DMX will show the actual levels output to the RGB channels (i.e. the level after the virtual dimmer is applied).

The full head can be selected using the head number.  The title bar of the Group, Pos, Colour, Beam windows will show +v for each head with a virtual dimmer. 

It is now possible to add virtual dimmers to a head in the Patch, View Heads view using a single action.  Place the cursor on the head you wish to add a virtual dimmer for and then press SHIFT and ADD VDIM.  You can use SHIFT + the cursor keys to select multiple heads.

Virtual dimmers can only be added to heads that do not have an intensity channel.  For heads with multiple RGB elements, a virtual dimmer will be made for each RGB element.

Virtual dimmers added in this way will appear unpatched.  Note that the virtual dimmers take up channels from the total channel count.


==== Other Changes

Increased total number of pixels in Pixelmapper to 16384 to match the number of possible heads.

Choose Dimmer has been moved in the Patch Window to the Choose Dim/Media button which enables direct selection of Generic Dimmer, Generic LED 3 channel or Media servers.

Added many new personalities and improved existing personalities to enable better morphing between fixture types.  There are now over 4,400 personalities.

There is now an additional option in the desklamp brightness setting (CTRL + soft button E) named Always.  When this option is selected the desklamps stay white even when the screen saves.


=== Bug Fixes

Fixed problems with virtual dimmers - #0000229, #0002337, #0002226, #0001795
resolved.

Fixed problem with pressing CANCEL when reordering FX could cause a freeze. #0002132

The release time on a Cue Stack did not take the instant flag of an attribute into account. #0002226.

Fixed problem whereby pressing ALL  to FULL button when using Intensity filtering in the Intensity Window could cause a reset. #0003201.

Playing a macro using assigned button whilst a macro was running performed the original button function.   #0002429

Preload Cues did not work when using Crossfader.  #0002486

The PC Wing could reset itself when using the club master. #0002022

Fixed minor problems with ASCII show import. #0003618

The Output View Horiz didn't show all the information if only a few heads were patched. #0003631. 

The autogroup function might not work on dimmers, if adding dimmers to an existing show made under a previous softwarae version. #0002505
Version 1.5.5.0

This is a release only for MagicQ Pro 2010 console.  It fixes a problem with shut down of the console whereby the console could power off before the disc was correctly shut down.  This could cause console setting changes that had been made just prior to the shutdown to be lost.

This issue does not affect Pro/Expert consoles or the PC based software - Version 1.5.4.0 should be used on these systems.


== Version 1.5.4.0

=== New Functions

Support for Extra Wings with blue LCDs.


=== Bug Fixes

Fixed problem with drawing of buttons in Linux version. #0002337

Fixed problem when using ChamSys 4 Port Interfaces in ChamNet mode this was only a problem in recent betas. 

Fixed problem with unpatching large numbers of fixtures.  #0002317


== Version 1.5.2.0

=== New Functions

==== USITT ASCII file import

MagicQ now supports import of dimmer patch, group, cue level and timing information from USITT ASCII files.  In the Patch Window, View Chans, Import USITT.

MagicQ does not currently support import of non dimmer parameters or more complex fixtures as this is manufacturer specific and not specified in the USITT ASCII format.  We will be happy to investigate whether we can add fixture import from the format of your console.

==== Console desklamp control

The console desklamp brightness, display brightness and LED brightness can now be controlled as a fixture within the programming of the show.  Patch one Generic MQlamps at any free address.  The fixture can be unpatched to ensure that it does not affect any real channel outputs.  The fixture has the following attributes:

activate		set to 255 to take control of the console brightness
master			master level for brightness
white desklamp
blue desklamp
main display		brightness of display 0 is off
wing display
led			brightness of the LEDs

Note that the screensaver will still blank the display. 

==== Other Changes

It is now possible to merge Cues together when importing shows.


=== Bug Fixes

Fixed problem with time code record whereby it did not refresh the Cue Stack engine times immediately.  Changing page and back would force a reload of the correct times after a record.

Fixed problem with chases stopping working after some time.  This was most often seen when using random chases with very fast times #002291.


== Version 1.5.1.5

=== New Functions

==== Keypad Copying / Moving Cues

It is now possible to copy and move Cues within a Cue Stack directly from the keypad using Cue Id numbers rather than the cursor keys and enter.

The Cue Stack Window must be open (press the S button of the Playback two times to open it).

COPY <from Cue ID> @ <to Cue ID>

MOVE <from Cue ID> @ <to Cue ID>

For example to copy Cue ID 1.00 to Cue ID 3.1 type

COPY 1 @ 3.1


If the <to Cue ID> is not specified or is greater than the last Cue ID in the Cue Stack then the Cue is copied to the end of the Cue Stack.

To copy Cue ID 1.00 to the end of the Cue Stack type

COPY 1 @

If the <to Cue ID> matches a Cue ID already in the Cue Stack then the Cue will be inserted before that Cue ID.

Multiple Cues can be copied/moved using THRU, e.g.

COPY 1 THRU 2 @ 3


==== Cue Window

The Cue Window, View Times, Simple View now always shows the list of possible attributes even when no heads are selected.

There are new shortcuts for quickly opening the Cue Window - hold the S button of the playback and press the Pos, Beam, Col, Int or FX buttons.  The Cue Window will be opened with the cursor on the appropriate field.


==== Other changes

Improved graphics in Normal Mode.

Modified start splash screen just to have only the Continue Show button.  The Help and New Show options have been removed.  New shows can be started from Setup, View Settings, New Show.  Help can be accessed by pressing the HELP button.

The maximum grid width has now been increased to 1024 pixels.

Calibration of the touch screen now uses 4 points instead of 2 points for greater accuracy and identification of swapped axis.

It is now possible to move channels in the Head Editor.

When making a new personality in the Head Editor the name of a range is now generated automatically from the range type.


=== Bug Fixes

Fixed problem with parked channels when loading a show.  If channels in the previous show were parked then the channels in the new show would not be parked.  Restarting MagicQ or performing a soft reset would solve the problem.

Fixed problem when using Cue Stack macros to release to change Page using the P command with the Cue Stack option Release On Page Change set.  A reset could occur if there was no Cue Stack programmed on the Playback on the new page.

Fixed problems with the new Patch Offset Update whereby it only worked with 8 bit accuracy.

Fixed problem when using Encoder wheel E in the View Palette view to modify multiple parameters (multiselected using cursor) #0002211

Fixed problem with movies in the Pixelmapper not playing all the movie file.  This only affected beta versions 1.5.1.0 to 1.5.1.2. #0002175

Fixed problem with changing pages on Playback Wings and Extra Wings.  If keys had been pressed on the command line other a valid page number when pressing the PREV PAGE buttons on the wing then a reset could occur. #0002114

Fixed problem with generation of auto groups on dimmers.  #0000537

Fixed problem with generation of centre auto group on grids.  #0002068

Fixed problem with number pad on external keyboards not inputting numbers. #001093

Fixed problem when viewing Setup, View System, View Status on Linux PC systems. #0002097



Fixed problem which could cause a reset in the Media Window when copying layers without selecting a server. #0002108

Fixed problem with labelling using the on screen keyboard text would appear after typing the first character.  Only affected recent betas.  #0002095.

The keyboard shortcut to open the Output Window opened the Output Info Window not the Output Window. #0001994.

Fixed problem whereby when updating cues the cue could fade back up to the changed value. Affected merging of Cues that have a default fade in / out time.  Only affected channels that were tracking through to the Cue which were being replaced with hard values in that Cue. Channels with hard values in the Cue would get updated immediately. #0001542

Fixed problem with playbacks on Execute Wing releasing on changes of Grand Master or Sub Master. #0001905

Fixed problem with setting 16 bit attributes using SET and the soft button when attribute display mode is set to normal. #0002121


== Version 1.5.1.1

=== New Functions

===== Offsets (deltas)

Added support for a quick method of applying an offset to channels such as a pan or tilt offset, or an offset on a colour scroll.  

To apply an offset, playback the Cues and then override only the parameters you wish to offset in the programmer.  Then press the Update button.  The Update options have been modified to include an extra option Patch Offset.  Selecting this option applies a permanent offset to the channel in the Patch rather than modifying the individual Palettes and Cues.

To remove the offset, playback the Cues and then activate the channels in the Programmer (hold SET and touch encoder to activate just an attribute or hold * and press SET to activate the whole head).  Then press the Update button and select Patch Offset.

Offsets apply only to LTP channels, not to HTP (Intensity) channels.

The Outputs window shows channels with offsets in green colour.

The Patch window shows offsets applied to Pan and Tilt in the Pan Offset and Tilt Offset field.


==== Other Changes

Added a high disk usage warning and improved status information regarding disc usage.

Status Window now shows status Shift and Ctrl when these keys are pressed. 


=== Bug Fixes

On MagicQ PC for Windows, MagicQ graphics could stop working after a while of constant changing windows or automated playback.  This affected versions 1.5.0.1 to 1.5.1.0 only.  We recommend changing to a non affected version. (#0001931, #0001805)

The Pixel Mapper live feed function was broken in version 1.5.1.0 only. (#0001977)

Recording TC using the RECORD TC function was broken in 1.5.1.0.only (#0001997)

When using playbacks set with Cue Stack option All channels controlled LTP and reassert option All inc tracked with then reasserting playbacks did not always work correctly and sometimes snapped rather than faded. (#0001988)

Recording from DMX Input did not work as expected when using Hog II Warp mode or any mode that showed the Record Option toolbar. (#0001895)

Fixed problem with patching media servers using the CHOOSE MEDIA SERVER method with media servers that spanned more than 1 universe MagicQ would patch over the universe boundary.

== Version 1.5.1.0

=== New Functions

==== FX Reordering

It is now possible to reorder the heads in a FX without having to recreate the FX.  Press the REORDER FX button in the Programmer, View FX View.  MagicQ prompts for the order, Normal, Reverse, Into Centre, Centre Out, Random.  Normal will always return them to head number order.

Note that if the current selection order is different to the one in the Cue then it will automatically use this as the new order rather than prompting for an order.

In order to make room for this new option the Record Options soft button is now only available in View Levels and View Times.  Record Options can be accessed when recording by pressing SHIFT + RECORD, or in Hog II Warp through the record options toolbar.


==== Synchronising Cue Stacks

Added a new Cue Stack option for synchronising two or more Cue Stacks together.  Set the Sync next playback to this one option.  MagicQ matches the Cue Ids in the Cue Stack so it is possible to have different numbers of Cues in the Stacks.  If there is no Cue Id matching in the next Cue Stack then it will remain at the current Cue.

It is possible to have several Cue Stacks synced to one master Cue Stack by setting the option Sync next playback to this one on the master and each adjacent Cue Stack, except for the last one in the chain.  MagicQ tries to match the Cue Id within each Cue Stack to the master Cue Stack.


==== Inter Console Messaging

It is now possible to trigger message boxes from Cues in a Cue Stack.  Simply add a comment field to the Cue in the Cue Stack starting with a !.  When this Cue executes the message box will be shown.

In Setup, View Settings, View Windows there is a new option, Message Window.  This specifies where the message box is shown (main screen, external screen 1, external screen 2) and whether a network message is sent to other consoles.

Setting Net Only results in messages only being sent over the network, not shown on the console where the Cue executed.

By default the message box shows immediately for 5 seconds and then closes.  The delay before the message box shows and the time it stays visible can be set using parameters inbetween the !.

!<delay>,<show length>!

!10!Hello World		// Delay for 10 seconds before showing message

!10,20!Hello World		// Delay for 10 seconds and show message box for 20 seconds

!0,0!Hello World		// Show message and do not close message box

If the comment starts with a !! instead of a ! then the console does an alert as well as showing the message.  The alert flashes the main screen intensity and the desklamps to try to get the operators attention.

Messages can be sent directly from the keyboard by entering text starting with a ! or a !!.


==== Pixel Mapper Improvements

It is now possible to play back patterns specifically on multi element heads such as Chromlech Jarags (5x5 dimmers) or other LED tile squares.  If the Pos FX is set to Mult head then any media, text or FX on that layer will apply to the individual multi element heads rather than across the entire grid.  The same image will be placed on all the multi head elements.  For best results the grid should be made of same size fixtures with equal spacing.

The auto groups function in the Outputs Window, Plan View has now been improved to add an option to generate groups for each of the multi head fixtures in the chosen grid.  These groups can then be use in a grid of groups to perform intensity and colour chases across all the multi heads.  By using the first layer for the grid of heads, and the second layer for a grid of groups with colour mode set to multiply the FX on the individual multi heads and the FX on the complete heads can be mixed together.

The number of groups has been increased from 1000 to 5000.  This enables large numbers of multi head fixtures to be used, all with individual groups for the whole fixture.
 
The number of Output Grids has been increased to 100.

It is now possible to modify the speed of a Pixel Mapper FX by holding the S button and turning encoder X.  Note that if the Cue also has a standard FX stored in it then this will change the normal FX speed, not the Pixel Mapper speed.

Playbacks with their faders set to control FX Speed now affect Pixel Mapper FX speed as well as standard FX speed.

It is now possible to zoom in /out in the Pixel Map in the View Grid view.

It is now possible to move objects using encoders X and Y in the View Grid view as well as use the MOVE command button.

Added a new Tile effect to the Pixel Mapper.  Use encoders B and D to determine the level of tiling (i.e. the number of horizontal and vertical tiles).

Added a new rotating line and half rotating line effect to the Pixel Mapper.  The number of rotating lines and the width of the lines can be set using encoders B and D.

Added a new expanding square effect to the Pixel Mapper.  The number of squares and the width of the lines can be set using encoders B and D.

Added a new 5 character high font specifically for use on Chromalech Jarags.  This font will automatically be used if the grid is 5 or less pixels high.


==== User Waveform FX.  

In the FX Editor Window (FX Window, Edit FX) it is now possible to extract the user FX from a show file to the console.  Press the EXTRACT USER FX soft button.

It is possible to remove all user Waveform FX from a console.  Press SHIFT + REMOVE USER FX.


==== Other Changes

Improved Board test mode so that the title bar now shows how to exit the mode.

Improved the action of the? key to reset any SHIFT or CTRL keys held down.


=== Bug Fixes

Fixed problem with 16 bit position fades when using a non zero pan offset or tilt offset in the Patch window.  Sometimes the fade would jitter slightly when doing slow fades.  The size of the jitter depends on the offset.  If no pan or tilt offset is set (default is none) then there is no problem.

Fixed problem with using Cue Stacks triggered from Cue Stack macros using the E and F commands, or by remote commands when the Cue Stacks had release times and stomping was enabled.  Playbacks could get lost and eventually a no free playbacks message would be shown.  This only occurs if stomping was enabled (default = disabled).

Fixed problem with setting DMX addresses in reverse order when in Theatre/Hog II Warp mode.

Fixed problem with setting FX crossfade on individual heads in the Cue Window.

== Version 1.5.0.7

=== New Functions

==== Catalyst

Improved Catalyst personality and personality thumbnail retrieval.  The original thumbnail retrieval algorithm is still available by setting the version number in Setup, View System, View Media to 1.  Any other version number will use the new algorithm.

==== Morphing Multi Part Heads

MagicQ now supports full morphing between multi part heads, from single part heads to multi part heads, and from multi part heads to single part heads.

When morphing between multi part heads, if the new head has less parts than the original head then the excess parts in the original heads will be ignored.    If the new head has more parts than the original head then the excess parts in the new head will be a repeat of the parts from the original head.

This also enables easy changing of mode of multi part heads which was not previously possible e.g. when changing a Thomas Pixeline from 18 pixel to 9 pixel mode, or when changing a Chromalec Jarag from 25 to 31 channel mode.


==== Icons

Modified setting of Icons so that it more closely matches setting of names.  Press SHIFT + SET and then choose a window item or playback to set the item for.  Once the icon has been chosen it now gets assigned directly to the item without having to press ENTER.

Removing intensity levels from a Cue

Support for removing intensity levels directly from Cues in the Cue Window.  

Also added a shortcut for removing an intensity from a Cue similar to the existing shortcut for adding a level to a Cue.  Currently you can add a level to the current cue on a Cue stack by holding the S button and typing the new level for the channel e.g. hold S and type 1 @ FULL ENTER.

To remove a level to the current cue on a Cue stack hold the S button and set the channel at the level . . e.g. hold S and type 1 @ . . ENTER.

=== Bug Fixes

Fixed lock up that could occur on MagicQ consoles when using the timers and counters in the Pixel Mapper. This problem did not affect Windows version.  #0001244

Fixed lock up problem when using ChamNet this could occur if devices were set in ChamNet mode or when the Net Manager window was open.  Seen mostly on MagicQ Rack Mount systems but could also occur on MagicQ consoles.  All users using ChamNet should upgrade to this version.

In some cases the web log file (magicwweb.log) could get very large and cause disc space problems.  Users can delete the web log from the File Manager at any time.

Auto activation of PB1 on start up did not work on MagicQ consoles - all the other activation methods worked fine. Therefore it is possible to work around it using an auto activated macro 1 or cue stack 1.  #0001094.

Fixed problem with using Faders with the setting HTP always active together with a release time.  If the Cue stack was set as a default playback and the playback was not Page 1 then the playback would not release correctly and could go erroneously to 100% after some time.

Fixed problem with Playbacks set to priority Above Programmer. HTP channels on these playbacks would still get overridden by the Programmer.

== Version 1.5.0.2

=== New Functions

Added new merge option in the Patch - Mul-In.  This option multiplies the received input with the console value for the channel.  MagicQ can therefore be used as a DMX modifier to modify the level of individual or groups of channels.

==== Merging of Palettes

It is now possible to merge Palettes from any previous show - you can select the palettes from a specific head or all the heads that match with your current show.

It is possible to select Position, Beam or Colour palettes, or combinations of the three attribute banks.

To import the Palettes, press the LOAD PALETTES soft button in the View Palette window.  Alternatively from the Setup Window press the SHIFT + IMPORT SHOW soft button and select Palettes.

==== Merging of Shows

When you select SHIFT + IMPORT SHOW, MagicQ now gives you simpler menu options of Entire Show, Palettes or Advanced.  

Entire Show loads the entire show as separate fixtures, i.e. adding the show.  This is an in previous versions if you selected all the Import options.

Palettes allows just palettes to be loaded from the imported show file.  There are further options for choosing just some head types and whether to load Positions, Colours and Beams.

Advanced provides the user with all the options as in previous versions.  It is now also possible to load the data for only selected head types from the imported show file. 

The merging has also been improved when merging shows with Execute Windows and Keyboard Macros.

When merging show data without the patch, MagicQ will now load data for all heads that match between the shows rather than stopping as soon as it hits a mismatch.


==== Layout Views

The default Layout Views 2,3,4 and 5 have now been removed to enable users to make use of these schemes.

It is now possible to name Layouts according to the standard MagicQ syntax; SET <select item> <enter name>.  Previously the name had to be entered on the command line before pressing SET.

It is now possible to record, name and remove Layouts 1,2 and 3 through the three spare hard buttons.

==== Console Wing IDs

When using MagicQ consoles with multiple Playback / Extra Wings (or multiple Execute Wings) it is now possible to set a Wing ID for each Wing.  The required wing ID can then be set in Setup, View Wings to ensure that the Wings are identified correctly and control the correct Playbacks.  Previously Wings could swap over if one was reset or they were powered on in a different sequence.  

Note that the Wing ID is only supported on new Wings with the most recent Wing firmware).  The Wing ID is set by holding the reset button under the armrest of the Wing whilst holding the lower most Page UP and Page Down buttons. 


==== Other Changes

Colour scheme.  The yellow colour scheme is now being obsoleted.  It is still selectable for use in extreme sunlight conditions, but will be reset to the normal colour scheme when a new show is loaded.


=== Bug Fixes

The . Button did not work on the remote devices such as iPhone/iPad/Android. 

Fixed problem with lamp on/off/reset shortcuts introduced in 1.5.0.1.  The shortcuts erroneously affected all heads rather than the selected heads.

Improved prompts on remote devices to explain that pressing 1 confirms yes, whilst pressing 0 is no.

Fixed bug with morphing from a head with CMY (or RGB) but no colour wheel to a head with CMY (RGB) and a colour wheel.  The Cyan base levels would get copied to the Colour Wheel.  Any FX on Cyan(Red) would be changed to be on Col 1 rather than Cyan.

Fixed problem with timecode over ArtNet in recent versions.  The messages sent and received were incorrect and caused the times to be confused.  This is fixed in 1.5.0.2, but both the transmitting console and the receiving console must be upgraded. #0001769

Fixed problem with the Magic Wand support.  From versions 1.4.9.1 to 1.5.0.1 only Magic Wand II protocol would work.  Now both protocols are supported.

Fixed problem with Execute Wing set with the top buttons in Execute Mode.  The flash function did not work correctly. #0001644

Fixed problem with buttons on Extra Wings or Execute Wings when the flash button is set to toggle and there is a release time.   #0001729
Version 1.5.0.1


=== New Functions

It is now possible to morph heads from a multi part head to a head with a single part e.g. from Pixeline 1044 to generic LED, or from Showtec sunstrips to Generic Dimmer.  Note that it is not yet possible to morph from single part head to multi part head.

Added keypad shortcuts for lamping on/off and reset.  These shortcuts also work on the ChamSys Remote app on iPhone/iPad/Android.  Select the heads and then

*++		Lamp on selected heads
*--		Lamp off selected heads
*//		Reset selected heads

Mark Cues are now indicated more clearly with highlighting.

When setting fade times in the Cue Stack when a Cue already contains some fade times, then only attributes (Pos, Colour, Beam, FX) times that are non zero are changed.


=== Bug Fixes

Fixed problem with Cue Stack Window when in View Options or View Defaults.  Changing between Chase / Cue timing would cause the window data to show incorrectly.  Changing View would refresh the data correctly.

Fixed problem with changing between sub menu tabs in the Setup Window sometimes the new sub menu tab would not be highlighted correctly even though the window data changed correctly. # 0000439

Fixed problem when using both an Execute Wing and a Playback/Extra Wing on a system if the Execute Wing was before the Playback Wing in the list of Wings then it would not work correctly.

Fixed problem when using Group Masters together with Cue Stacks set to All Channels Controlled LTP.  When using GO on different Cue Stacks the channels would dip down before going to the correct level.

Extended the power off timer on Pro 2010 consoles as the power off was occasionally occurring before the Linux operating system had shut down.

== Version 1.5.0.0

=== New Functions

==== 32 Universes

The software now supports 32 Universes on MagicQ Pro 2010 consoles.  MagicQ Pro consoles and MagicQ Rack Mount Network Consoles continue to support 18 universes.

MagicQ software on Windows, Mac and Linux also supports 32 Universes.  This ensures that shows designed for use on Pro 2010 consoles can be programmed offline and also as a backup in case of a problem with the console.

  
==== iPhone /iPad app version 2

Added support for version 2 iPhone / iPad app.  The version 2 app enables the encoder wheels to control any parameters on MagicQ instead of just pan and tilt.  In addition it is now possible to view the MagicQ windows including the Patch and the Outputs from the app.

The version 2 app now includes views specifically designed for the resolution of the iPad the app will automatically detect which product it is running on and adapt the views.


==== Personalities and Real World Values

MagicQ has been modified so that it is possible to display the attributes in real world values rather than in 0 to 255 DMX values.  For example pan and tilt can be shown in degrees.

The personalities have been renamed so that all the personalities now use the format manufacturer_name_mode.hed.  

It is possible to remove all old personalities (and all user created personalities) by pressing SHIFT and REMOVE HEADS in the File Manager.  This removes all old heads and extracts the heads again from heads.all.  Make sure all your user created heads are backed up to USB or to another system before removing all old personalities.

The Personalities in the ChamSys library are now protected to avoid accidental changes to them MagicQ prompts the user before allowing changes to the personalities.  In the Head Editor, original ChamSys personalities are indicated by an LO in the tile bar.  If the personality has been edited it will only show L.

=== Fixes

Fixed problem with Pixelmapping on moving heads with CMY colour mixing rather than RGB colour mixing - the colours were inverted.  Now it is possible to have both CMY and RGB fixtures in a grid and the colour will be mapped as expected. (#0000968, #0001193).

Fixed problem with Pixelmapping where it did not indicate if too many pixel mapping layers were patched.  It now displays an error message when trying to patch too many pixelmap layers from Outputs Windows, Grid View.  The number of patched pixelmap layers is now shown in Setup, View Status, Show Data.  (#0000122)

Playbacks on the Playback Buttons on the Extra Wing and the Execute Wing set to toggle, would be released if DBO or the master faders were changed. (#0001021, #0001550)

When running Cue Stacks from the Execute Window, chase speed changes would not take immediate effect. (#0001408)

When copying multiple groups to the Execute Window the cursor selection in the Group Window would remain active after the copy was completed, causing confusion when selecting heads.  MagicQ now clears the cursor selection after a move, copy or remove. (#0001526)

Fixed problem with recalling Layout views whereby the offset within the window was not recalled.  Affected recent beta versions.
