== Version 1.6.5.2

=== New Functions

==== Intensity Palettes

The Intensity window has been enhanced to have a View Palettes view similar to the Position, Colour and Beam windows.  Palettes can be recorded, moved, copied and removed and used within Cues just as with Position, Colour and Beam palettes.  

By default only Intensity parameters are recorded into the Intensity Palettes regardless of whether other attributes are in the programmer.  A record mask (SHIFT + RECORD) can be used to override which attributes are recorded.

The only difference with Intensity Palettes compared to Position, Colour and Beam palettes is that by default the record type is set to all heads that have intensity in the Programmer being recorded into the Palette not just the selected heads.  This avoids the need to always select heads (e.g. by selecting the All Dimmers group) before recording an Intensity Palette.  The record type can be changed by pressing SHIFT RECORD and selecting RECORD TYPE.


==== Multi element head selection

The  "." operator is now universally used for selecting elements of multiple heads.  The repeated element of a multiple head are indexed .1 .2 .3 etc.. whilst the main part of a multi element head in indexed as .0.   Note that if a multi element head does not have a main part - i.e. it is just a repeated head then there is no .0 element.  The operators +, -, and THRU (>) can be used to select more than one element of a multi element head.

Examples of supported syntax are:


`.3` Select 3rd element of currently selected heads

`.1>3` Select 1st, 2nd and 3rd elements of currently selected heads


`.1+4` Select 1st and 4th elements of currently selected heads


1>10.1@FULL   	// Set element 1 of heads 1 to 10 at FULL
1>10.1>3@50		// Set elements 1,2,3 of heads 1 to 10 at 50%

Depending on the MagicQ setup options, it may be necessary to enter @@ at the end of the line to select heads or to press ENTER at the end of the line to enter intensities.

MagicQ now supports the multiple elements of a multi element head all having the same head number.  By default MagicQ allocates each element of a multi element head ascending head numbers - this can be modified in Patch, View Heads by setting the Head Number appended with /1 to indicate only 1 head number in use for that fixture.

Note that in previous versions the "." was used for selecting or setting intensity direct to a DMX channel rather than a head number.  This functionality is no longer supported.


==== Setting Intensities directly into Cues

MagicQ has for several years supported setting of intensities directly into the current Cue on a Playback by holding the S button of the Playback whilst entering the intensity set command.

This has now been expanded to enable setting of intensities in all Cues in the Playback - this can be absolute - e.g. setting some heads to 50% in all Cues - or relative, e.g. setting some heads +10% in all Cues where they are already used.

The syntax is to hold S and then type the intensity set command.  For example, whilst holding S type

1 @ FULL		Sets head 1 to FULL in current cue on Playback with S held
1 @ +10		Adjusts head 1 intensity +10% in current cue on Playback with S held
1 @ FULL THRU	Sets head 1 to FULL in all cues on Playback with S held
1 @ +10 THRU	Adjusts head 1 intensity +10% in all cues on Playback with S held
1 @ .. THRU		Removes head 1 intensity in all cues on Playback with S held

Note that in order to use THRU at the end of the syntax line to select all Cues in the Playback the Setup option, View Setup, View Settings, Keypad,  Auto Enter on Intensity Set, must be set to No.


==== Track Sheet Support

Track Sheet support has been added to the Timeline window.  This enables the contents of each of the individual Cues in a Cue Stack to be examined from within one window.  Filtering exists to choose whether all heads in the Cues are shown or just selected heads.  It is also possible to view just Intensity, IPCB or all channels.

Theatre users can monitor the intensity of their lamps through the Cue Stack including all of the tracked values.


==== Patch Head Filtering

In Patch, Choose Head it is now possible to filter personalities by type, making it easier to find the personalities required.  Filter options include All, Patched, Live, Club, Film/TV and User.

Patched enables users to see which heads are patched in the current show and to re choose them easily.

Users can tag heads that they use frequently so that they appear in the User filter.  This could be used for example to include all heads in the stock of a rental company.

Heads can be tagged and untagged in both Choose Head, Simple View and Choose Head, Adv View.  In Simple View you can tag all heads from a particular manufacturer, or all modes of a specific head.  In Adv View you can tag individual modes of a head.

In Adv View the Tag column shows a "U" for all heads tagged as user.

MagicQ stores a file of all tagged heads in the heads folder called userheads.csv.  It is possible to create or edit this file with a text editor/spreadsheet.  The format is:

<manufacturer> , <short name> , <mode>


==== Other changes

The spreadsheet views in MagicQ (such as Cue Stack, Outputs, Prog, Patch, Cue) now support fixed columns so that when scrolling to the right the first few column identifying the Cue number or Head Number stay fixed with only the other columns scrolling.


==== MagicHD

MagicHD now supports playback of media with audio on all platforms.

=== Bug Fixes

Fixed problem with screen update on MQ40/60/70 in v1.5.6.0 which made is slow to respond.

Fixed MagicHD issues where single frame media (i.e. static pictures) might not be displayed, leaving the layer black. #7737, #7792

Fixed some MagicHD problems relating to unusual media formats. #7635, #7742.

Fixed crash when MagicHD converts audio files. #7692

Fixed problem with CTRL B and CTRL C short cuts - now modified to CTRL J and CTRL K #0007467

Fixed reset problem in Pixelmapper when using Vert Rnd FX.  #0007463

Sel + S caused a reset.  #0007798

=== Known Problems

v1.6.5.2 causes a problem with backward compatibility to version 1.6.1.7.  After running v1.6.5.2 on a Pro or Compact console, changing back to v1.6.1.7 will cause the console to continually reset.  Hold the reset button to power off completely then on start up hold a key to enter the software utility and re choose 1.6.5.2.

Before changing back to 1.6.1.7 open File Manager and delete all the .mic2 files from the  icons folder.
