== System Management
=== Starting Up

On PC and Mac systems click on the MagicQ application icon. On MagicQ console systems hold the power button on for 1 second.

On first start up an introductory window is displayed on the screen.  You are prompted to choose demo shows or to continue the last show.  It is possible to turn this option off so that MagicQ automatically starts into the last show.

When MagicQ starts up it loads the last show file that was saved –
either a file explicitly saved by you, or the last backup file it
automatically saved.


=== Shutting Down

To shut MagicQ down, press the QUIT soft button in the Setup Window. When asked for confirmation, select yes. MagicQ consoles automatically power off when the shutdown sequence is complete.

On MagicQ consoles the console must be shut down correctly to avoid damage to the heard disk.  Removing power to the
console when it is running may cause problems with the file system.  Normally this will only result in a subsequent slow start-up whilst the
system repairs the disk – however in certain circumstances the file system may become corrupted. If you always follow the instructions for
shutting down you will have no problems.


=== Saving Shows

When you are programming a show the show is stored in memory. In order to store your show on the disk you need to
press the SAVE SHOW soft button in the Setup Window.

Whilst programming, you should regularly save your show, so that if the
unexpected happens and the power fails your show data is not lost. You
can chose any filename. The console will automatically set the file
extension to .shw.

By default, MagicQ saves a backup of your show to disk shortly after you makes changes
– you will see it show “AutoS” in the Status Display. It uses the same
show name but with the file extension .sbk.

It is a good idea to save your show to different file names so that you
have various points you can back-track to if things go wrong. For
example, save the show as myshow-patch.shw after you have patched and
then as myshow-final.shw after you have finished programming.

When you shut down MagicQ through the QUIT soft button in the Setup
Window, it automatically saves a backup copy of your show with
a .sbk extension. When you subsequently restart MagicQ this file
will be re-loaded. This ensures that MagicQ starts up as it was
when the QUIT soft button was pressed.

The Setup Window indicates when the show has not been saved (or
autosaved) for over 10 minutes.

MagicQ consoles have a large hard disk to enable storage of a virtually
infinite number of shows. 

==== Show file name auto increment

MagicQ supports auto incrementing show file names. To start an auto
incrementing show file, save a show file with the last part of the name
set as _001. When you next press SAVE SHOW, MagicQ will suggest saving
to _002. Press ENTER to accept, or edit the name to save to a different
name.

Note that in order to avoid accidentally saving to incrementing files,
all 3 digits must be present - _1 or _10 is not supported. When the
number _999 is reached MagicQ will not auto increment and will request a
new name.

Please note that over use of the auto increment feature will lead to
high disk usage. It is important to clear out old versions once the show
is finished.

To delete all old revisions of the current show file, go to File
Manager, and press SHIFT and REMOVE OLD REVS. This will remove all
revisions of the current show file that have a lower revision number. It
will not remove the current show file.


=== Backing up to an external system

It is a good idea to back up your show to an external system. This
ensures that should the unexpected happen you can transfer your show to
another console. In a touring environment where the console is being
moved every day we recommend you back up your show to an external system
before moving the console.

You can either backup by <<_transferring_files_over_network,transferring
files over network>> or via USB memory stick. To backup to USB memory
stick, first insert a USB memory stick into the USB slot in the front or
the back of the console then press the BACKUP TO USB soft button in the
Setup Window.

The USB memory stick should be formatted for a standard Windows file
system (VFAT) – they generally come like this. This enables the memory
stick to be used in both the console and standard PCs running Windows.


=== Loading Shows

You can load a show that you have previously saved using the LOAD SHOW
soft button in the Setup Window. If you load a new show it will erase
any existing programming. The console will prompt you for confirmation.

Be careful to choose which type of show file you want to load – the .shw
files are the ones you saved, whilst the .sbk ones are auto backups.

When MagicQ saves a show file it saves the show data, the show settings
and the console settings. By default when a show is loaded, only the
show data and settings are loaded – the console settings are not loaded
– so the console settings are not affected.

To force loading of the console settings from a show file, hold SHIFT
and press LOAD SHOW+CON. A list of Load Options is shown enabling the
user to choose which console settings they wish to load.

.Console Settings

* Wing Settings
* Remote Settings
* Mode Settings
* Network Settings
* Media Server Settings
* MIDI SMPTE Settings
* Port Settings
* Multi Console Settings
* Hardware Settings

Selecting all the options loads the complete console settings and show
settings – enabling the complete cloning of a console. Note that the
console settings include the network settings and IP address – so if 2
cloned consoles are used on the same network then the IP address should
be manually set to different addresses.


=== Erasing

To erase the entire show from memory, go to the Setup Window and press
the NEW SHOW (was ERASE SHOW) soft button. You will be asked to confirm
by selecting YES. You will then be asked for which initial mode you want
the console to be set up for, Normal, Theatre Non Track, Theatre
Tracking or Hog II Warp. If in doubt, select Normal.

Erasing a show clears all patching, all programming and all palettes.  It does not clear console settings such as the configuration of
the DMX outputs or the calibration of the touch screen.

==== Icon Snapshots / Extras file

Icon snapshots are stored on the MagicQ system/console rather than in the show file - this avoids the show file getting too large.  In normal operation MagicQ will save the icon snapshots to the icon folder on the MagicQ system and retrieve them when needed for display.

In order to allow MagicQ shows with icon snapshots to be transferred onto other MagicQ systems, MagicQ now supports an additional "extras" show file with the file extension ".xhw".  When a show contains extra data such as snapshots then when the show file is saved using SAVE SHOW or SAVE TO USB then the additional show file is saved at the same time.  This "extras" show file contains only the extra icon snapshot data, it does not contain the main programming of your show.  If you wish to use your show on a different system with the icon snapshots then you need to copy both the ".shw" and ".xhw" files to the new system.  When loading a new show MagicQ automatically checks for the presence of a ".xhw" file and extracts the icon snapshots from that file into the icon folder on the MagicQ system.

The "extras" file is not saved during auto saves and is only loaded (extracted) when the user loads an existing show using LOAD SHOW.


=== Import and Export of Show Data and Show Merging

MagicQ supports advanced features for merging shows together, taking
selections from particular shows and adding them to other shows.

A selection of Heads, Cues, Cue Stacks or Pages can be exported from a
show file to a new file. Only the show data that uses those selected
Heads, Cues, Cue Stacks or Pages is present in the new show file. The
new show file can then be merged into other show files, with MagicQ
repatching the data as required.


==== Exporting Shows

Press SHIFT and SAVE SHOW (EXPORT SHOW) to export part of the current
show. Only the currently selected heads are exported. All groups,
palettes, cues and cue stacks that contain one or more of the selected
heads are exported – but only with the data from the selected heads.

If no heads are selected then MagicQ looks for items that are selected
in the Page, Stack Store, and Cue Store windows. Use SHIFT + the cursor
keys to select items in these windows. Therefore complete pages can be
exported using the Page Window, complete Cue Stacks (including the Cues
they use) from the Cue Stack Store or individual Cues from the Cue
Store.


==== Merging / Importing Shows

Select SHIFT + IMPORT SHOW to merge or import a show. MagicQ gives you a simple menu of Entire Show, Palettes or Advanced.

Entire Show loads the entire show as separate fixtures, i.e. adding the
show to the existing show.

Palettes allows just palettes to be loaded from the imported show file.
There are further options for choosing just some head types and whether
to load Positions, Colours and Beams.

Advanced provides the user with options include choosing whether
Settings, Patch, Palettes, Cues, Cue Stacks and Playback assignments are
loaded from the imported show file. Additionally you can choose whether
Palettes, Cues and Pages are merged together, or whether new Palettes,
Cues and Pages are generated.

It is also possible to load the data for only selected head types from
the imported show file.

If the Merge Heads option is selected then MagicQ merges programmed data
from the new file into the heads that match in the original show.

If the Merge Heads is not selected then MagicQ adds the channels to the
new show. Channels from the imported show keep their DMX address unless
they clash with channels in the original show – in which case they are
moved to the first free location.

If the Merge Pages option is selected then Playback assignments are kept
on the same Page as they were in the imported show – but they may be
moved onto higher Playbacks (e.g. Playback wings) on the same page. This
allows, for examples two different shows created on a MQ100 to be merged
onto a single MQ200.


==== Merging different versions of the same show

To merge two versions of a show together select Advanced and then Merge
Heads.

MagicQ will merge in Cues and Cue Stacks from the selected show file
that are different to the Cues and Cue Stacks in the original show. Note
that for this to work you should ensure that the Cues and Cue Stacks
that are different in the two show files have different names.

The heads must be the same type in both versions - it is not possible to merge between different fixture types.  If the two versions you wish to merge have different fixture types then you must first morph the  fixtures in one of the versions to be the same as the other.


==== USITT ASCII file import

MagicQ supports import of dimmer patch, group, cue level and timing
information from USITT ASCII files. In the Patch Window, View Chans,
Import USITT.

MagicQ does not support import of non dimmer parameters or
more complex fixtures as this is manufacturer specific and not specified
in the USITT ASCII format. We will be happy to investigate whether we
can add fixture import from the format of your console.


=== Saving and Loading Settings

You can save your favourite show settings to a file. Settings include
the options from the Setup Window, the defaults from the Cue Stack
Window and the Views that you have set up.

Once you have become familiar with the console, it is a good idea to
save your preferred settings to a file so that then when you start a new
show you can load your settings in.


=== File Manager

You can organise you show files using File Manager in the Setup
Window. File Manager supports renaming, moving, copying and deleting of
files.

All show files are located in the show directory. The show directory has
sub directories for fx, heads and icons.

File manager can operate on both the internal hard disk and external USB
memory sticks. To copy a file to the USB stick:

Select HARD DRIVE soft button.

Press COPY and then select the file you wish to copy.

Select USB DRIVE soft button

Select the “.” entry.

Moving is done in a similar way using the MOVE action button. Renaming
and deleting use the NAME and REMOVE action buttons respectively.

It is also possible to load shows, settings, icons and new software by
clicking on items in the File Manager window.


=== Transferring files over network

The console supports remote file system access over the network. Files can
be accessed whilst the console is running and outputting Art-Net thus
allowing, for instance, users to set up automatic show back-ups to an
external server.

Connect the console to the PC or Mac using a network cable.

Configure the IP addresses of the PC / Mac and the console so that
they are all on the same IP sub-net. For instance if the console is set to IP
address 2.9.200.5, subnet mask 255.0.0.0 then set the host system to IP
address 2.9.200.6 subnet mask 255.0.0.0.

Connect to the file system. Under Windows this can be achieved by
selecting Network Neighbourhood in Windows Explorer. The console should
appear as a computer – if this does not happen immediately then you may
need to wait a few minutes for Windows to catch up. You can force
Windows to find the console by using Search and searching for a computer
– enter the IP address of the console.

On a Mac connect using Finder and selecting the console.

Log in as user magicq with password magicq.

On some Windows systems you may need to create a user account magicq
with password magicq to enable Windows to connect to the console.

You can then transfer files between the host and the console. Show
files, personality files, FX files and Patch files can all be
transferred in this way.

If you have problems putting files onto the console then try pressing
the Set Rem Access soft button in the File Manager window.


=== Status Window

There is a status window in the Setup Window, View System. This shows
data associated with the console and with the currently loaded show.
This includes show size, data used, last saved times.

The status window also shows all the MagicQ consoles on the network, and
all the Art-Net devices on the network.


=== Backup Archives

By default the console stores an archive of the show files for every
quarter of an hour of the day, and for every day of the week. This
enables the user to revert to a previous copy of their show.

Archive files are only made when the console auto saves – so if auto
saves are disabled then no archive files will be generated. If the
console is set to “auto save on changes” then archive files will only be
stored when changes are made. To revert to an archived file press SHIFT
and LOAD SHOW in the Setup Window.

Archive files are stored in a special directory that should not be
modified by the user. When the user re-loads an archived backup file,
the backup file is restored into the standard show directory.

Archive files have the name “backup0530.sbk” to indicate the show file
that was recorded just before 5.30am. Daily files are also stored –
“backupfri.sbk” indicates the show file that was recorded at the start
of Friday. Archive files are overwritten every 24 hours, except for the
daily files which are overwritten every 7 days.


=== Using shows on different MagicQ products and show versions

In general MagicQ show files are backwards and forwards compatible so you can load any show into any version of software. Loading shows
created and modified on newer software versions into older software
versions may result in some features not being supported or not working
exactly as expected.

In March 2006 new MagicQ consoles were changed from 6 universes to 12
universes. MagicQ software version v1.2.5.4 and above supported 12
universes. In December 2007 ChamSys launched the Pro range of consoles
with software version v1.3.4.3 supporting 18 universes.

In May 2010 new MagicQ Pro 2010 consoles supported 32 universes. MagicQ
Expert consoles supported 6. MagicQ PC / Mac and Linux software
supported 32.

From March 2013 new MagicQ Pro 2014 consoles support 64 universes.
MagicQ MQ60, MQ70 and MQ100 Expert consoles support 12 universes. MQ40
supports 4 universes.

MagicQ PC / Mac and Linux software supports 64 universes – this enables
backup from a PC/Mac system.

==== Loading a show onto a smaller console

Note that the limit of number of universes/channels refers to both patched and unpatched channels - i.e. any fixtures that have programming within the console.  Therefore unpatched fixtures in a show still take up channels from the total number of universes supported on the console - MagicQ just allocates them to unused addresses.

If you try to load a show with more channels used than the MagicQ console supports then it will ignore any channels above the number of supported universes and will save the show using a default show name rather than the original show name to avoid the ignored fixtures being removed from the original show file.

We recommend that when loading a show into a console with less universes the
show should first be reduced to the number of universes used by the
smaller console. For example when transferring a show from a MQ100 Pro
2014 to a MQ60 the show should first be reduced to 12 universes. This show
can be reduced on the Pro 2014 or using MagicQ on a PC or Mac.

The number of universes used by a show is reported in Setup, View
Systems, View Status, Show Data, Highest Universe.

Note that unpatched heads may affect the highest universe depending on
which universe they were last used and how many heads you have in your
show. Either remove unpatched heads or repatch them down to a universe
below the total number of universes.

==== Configuring number of Universes

To enable 12, 18, 32 or 64 universes, go to Setup Window and VIEW DMX
I/O and select “SET NUM UNIVERSES” soft button. It is necessary to
restart MagicQ before the changes take effect.

Show files are compatible – except that it is not possible to load a
show using more universes than the console is set to. So, if a show has
channels patched to universes 7 to 12 it will not be loaded into a
console set to support 6 universes.

Shows that only use universes 1 to 6 can to be loaded into consoles set
to either 6,12,18, 32 or 64 universes.

MagicQ MQ100, MQ200, MQ300 consoles purchased before March 2006 require
a hardware upgrade to run 12 universes – this increases the processor
power to guarantee performance. MagicQ Pro consoles support 18
Universes. MagicQ Pro 2010 consoles support 32 Universes. MagicQ Pro
2014 consoles support 64 universes. ChamSys does not guarantee
performance if consoles are set to support higher numbers of universes
than the hardware supports.

MagicQ PC can support 64 universes – performance will depend upon the
specification of the PC. Latest PCs can easily support 64 universes
fully loaded.


=== MagicQ Profiles

MagicQ supports different profiles – a profile is the entire set-up of
the console including the console specific settings (like IP address,
media settings etc…) and the show file. This enables the console to be
used to control different venues with easy swapping between venues.

Profiles are loaded and saved from the Setup Window – in View Settings,
press SHIFT and LOAD PROFILE or SAVE PROFILE. Profiles are saved to .mpr
files in the show folder – note that profile does not contain the show
data – it only references it – so if you are backing up you need to
store both .shw files and .mpr files.

It is possible to set the console to request profile selection on
start-up. To enable this you must put an empty text file
“selectprofile.txt” into the main MagicQ folder (MagicQ PC on MagicQ
PC). On start-up the console will then request which profile you wish to
use before it loads the show and enables the outputs. This is useful in
a studio environment where MagicQ can control any one of several studios
over Art-Net. When you start up the console you choose which studio to
control.
