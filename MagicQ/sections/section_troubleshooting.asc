== Troubleshooting

=== No outputs

Check whether MagicQ is operating correctly by opening the Outputs
Window and looking at the data in View Heads. If the intensity or other attributes are not at their
correct levels then check:

* Are the Grand Master and Playback Master faders up?
* Are Playback faders raised?
* Is there channel data recorded in the Cues on the playbacks?
* Is BLIND mode on?
* Heads and dimmers are patched to the correct universe?

If the Outputs Window shows correct values then check the Outputs are
configured and enabled correctly in the View DMX I/O view of the Setup
Window. If you are using an Ethernet convertor box check that it is
receiving data correctly. Check:

* Outputs are configured correctly
* Outputs are enabled
* Is test mode active in DMX/IO?
* If using network outputs check the IP address and subnet address are configured correctly

Try putting a test pattern on the entire DMX output - in DMX I/O set the test field to Ramp.  The Outputs, View Chans, View DMX shows exactly what is being output on each universe.


=== MagicQ not responding

Is the time changing in the Status Display? If so then MagicQ is
running o.k. Check

* Master faders up
* Correct playback pages selected
* Playback has a Cue stored on it
* MagicQ is not locked (CTRL top left soft button)
* Is button test mode on (hold top left SHIFT button and press top right
SHIFT button)

If the time is not changing then you will have to perform a hard reset on the console.

=== MagicQ responding slowly

Check memory usage in Setup, View System, View Status.  Try

* Closing all windows (SHIFT + CLOSE)
* Ensure you have saved your show to hard disk not to a USB stick
* Remove any USB devices especially USB Sticks
* Disable network connections to media servers


=== Strange key presses, unexpected window changes

Enter board test mode to determine the cause of the fault (hold top left
SHIFT button and press top right SHIFT button)

* Check a button has not become stuck down
* Check nothing / no-one is leaning on the keyboard or other buttons
* Check a keyboard macro has not been accidentally recorded / played back


=== MagicQ console not booting

There are quite a few different reasons for the console not to boot - it could be a problem with the system operating system software or a hardware problem.

If the console is cycling the boot sequence continually or showing "kernel panic" then this normally indicates a hardware problem.  Get a qualified service technician to remove the rear panel and reseat cables and procesor daughter card (transition card).

On a Pro 2014 console if the console is showing "lynxfb" then get a qualified service technician to remove the rear panel and remove the graphics card from underneath the processor module.

Check out the <<_software_upgrade,Software Upgrade>> section for repair of the operating system.

=== MagicQ console blank screen

If the screen is blank then this may be because of the screen saver. Try pressing SHIFT.

If the screen remains blank even after pressing buttons then try holding CTRL and pressing the bottom right soft button
(soft button closest to the large encoder wheels) twice. This attempts to restart the screen backlight.

The screen may have been turned off and locked by a user. Press CTRL and the second soft button down on the left
(soft button B). If this does not help then press CTRL and the second soft button a second time.

If the screen still remains blank then try connecting an external monitor.

Avoid using the white reset button to shut down the console - use the three cursor keys (< V >) and press DBO to shut down the console.

=== MagicQ console white screen

MagicQ console white screen indicates that the display has power but no data signal.  This could be because the main processor has halted or because the display signal cable is broken/disconnected.

Try pressing S buttons.  If the blue LED follows the S button then the main processor is running correctly - check display cable.  Get a qualified service technician to remove the rear panel and reseat the display cable.

If the S buttons are not responding then it is likely there is a bad connection in the rear panel.  Get a qualified service technician to remove the rear panel and reseat the power and disc cables and ensure procesor daughter card (transition card) is firmly pressed onto the processor card.

Avoid using the white reset button to shut down the console - use the three cursor keys (< V >) and press DBO to shut down the console.


=== MagicQ console distorted screen

If the screen image is distorted, has multiple lines through it or has incorrect colours then this indicates that the graphics hardware has not started correctly.

Hold the three cursor keys (< V >) and press DBO to shut down the console.

=== MagicQ console internal touch screen not working

* Try to calibrate the touch screen (CTRL + SET)
* Check it is giving correct values in board test mode (SHIFT + SHIFT)
* Check there is no dirt around the edges of the screen
* Check that liquid has not been spilt into the touch screen
* Check the metalwork is not catching on the screen

=== Fader, Encoder or Button not working correctly

* Go into board test mode (SHIFT + SHIFT) to test the hardware.
