== Outputs Windows
On MagicQ you can view the Outputs in many different ways. MagicQ
supports up to 4 different Output Windows. This allows four different
output views to be viewed simultaneously.

Press the Out button to open the main Output Window. Press 2 and then
Out to open the second Output Window, 3 + Out for Output Window 3 and 4
+ Out for Output Window 4. The 2^nd^ Output Window – the Output Info
Window can also be opened by pressing CTRL + OUT.

In the Outputs Window, just as in the Programmer Window and Palette View
Window there is auto ordering of heads. MagicQ orders the heads
according to the selection order. When no heads are selected the order
is the normal head order. Auto ordering can be turned off in the Setup
Window under Windows, “Auto Row ordering”.

The Outputs Window has many different views – press the soft buttons on
the top left hand side to change the views.


=== Heads View

The Heads View shows information for all of the heads patched in the
show - press the VIEW HEADS soft button. You can request only
information for certain heads to be shown by using the PROG ONLY, SEL
ONLY and SEL PB soft buttons. These show respectively, heads that are
active in the programmer, selected heads, and heads in the current cue
on the selected playback.

You can choose what information is shown for the heads using the VIEW
VALS, VIEW RAW and VIEW PLAYBACK and VIEW CUE IDS soft buttons. VIEW
VALS shows the values including range and palette names. VIEW RAW shows
the numeric values. VIEW PLAYBACKS shows which Playback is controlling
the attribute and VIEW CUE IDS shows which Cue ID in a Playback is
controlling the attribute.

The following colours are used:

Red: Attributes that are in the Programmer

White: Attributes under control of a Playback.

Blue: Attributes controlled by the currently selected Playback

Grey: Attributes not under control of Playbacks or Programmer


=== Intensity View

The Intensity View shows just intensity information for the patched
heads enabling a large number of heads to be shown within the window.
Press the VIEW CHANS and VIEW INT soft buttons. Intensity level is shown
as a percentage (%).


Use the VIEW HORIZ soft button to change whether heads are shown
horizontally or vertically.

The VIEW NAMES soft button allows names to be shown. Deselect this
option if you wish to maximise the number of heads shown in this window
or you wish to have a more traditional theatre channel list view.

=== DMX Channels View

The DMX Channels View shows the actual values that are being output on
the DMX or on the network. Press the VIEW CHANS, VIEW DMX and VIEW CHANS
soft buttons. Note that these values are the real output values – if the
output is enabled then these values will be the values transmitted on
the wire. Inversions, merging, and all other modifications are made to
the values before they are displayed in this Window.

Intensity channels are shown in red, position in green, colour in purple
and beam in yellow. Channels that are not patched are shown in grey.

Use the VIEW INPUTS / VIEW OUTPUTS soft buttons to view the DMX /
network values that are being received rather than the ones being
transmitted. When viewing the Inputs it is possible to select the VIEW
MIN MAX soft button to show the maximum values received. Deselecting the
VIEW MIN MAX resets the view.


=== Movement View

The movement view shows the relative positions of heads in terms of pan
and tilt range on a 2D map. It also shows the current colour of the
heads. This enables previewing of FX and relative positions without the
lighting rig. Press the VIEW CHANS, VIEW DMX, VIEW MOVE soft buttons.


=== Plan View

Plan View enables 2D plans of the stage rig constructed and viewed. It
also enables grids of LED or dimmers to be created for use with the
in-built pixel mapping (Bitmap FX) engine. Press the VIEW PLAN soft
button.

==== Creating rig plans

It is possible to create a rig plan in the Outputs window, so that you
can easily identify the levels and colours of your moving lights based
on their position in the lighting rig. The model of the rig in MagicQ
consists of a grid - each cell can be assigned to a particular head
number. Grids can also be used to monitor LED arrays and other colour
blocks.

image:images/outputsplan.png[image]

In the Outputs Window, select View Plan and View Hd Nos. Press Grid Size
and enter a matrix size for your lighting rig – e.g. 30/20 gives a 30 by
20 grid.

A grid is now displayed. In each of the boxes enter the head number of
the head that you wish to be represented in this box. In order to make best use of this feature all heads should have unique numbers.

You can use SHIFT or CTRL and the cursor keys to cursor select a number of items and set a sequence of head numbers starting from the entered head nunber.  The order of the cursor selection determines how the items are ordered - for example, cursor selecting an area from bottom right to bottom left and then to top left will cause the heads to be number from bottom right to top left starting horizontally.

Alternatively, you can use the INSERT HEADS button to insert the currently selected
heads into the matrix. The heads are placed in order of head number.  If no heads are selected then all heads from the patch are inserted.

Note that it is not necessary to have a head number assigned to every
cell in the grid – cells can be blank. This enables the lights to be
positioned in the grid in a corresponding way to how the heads are
positioned on the rig.

To remove a head number from a cell, press REMOVE and select the cell.
Move and Copy can also be used to quickly move or copy one or more
cells.

Now press View Colours to view the outputs of your rig. When a head has
a level greater than 0% the box starts to get filled until at 100% it is
completely filled. The colour of the lamp is also indicated.

Pressing SHIFT + VIEW HD+INT shows both the head number and the current
intensity.

==== Selection of heads in Outputs Plan View

Heads can be selected from the plan view and then their parameters
changed by pressing and holding the Group, Position, Colour or Beam
buttons. When the programmer setting “Highlight defaults beam and
colour” is enabled, any heads selected will have their dimmer set to
100% in open white.

When the Outputs Plan view is used as a stage plan it is possible to
select multiple heads in a row or column by clicking on blank spaces in
the grid.

Clicking on a blank space at the top edge of the grid will
select/deselect heads in the whole column depending on the current
selection state of the heads.

Clicking on a blank space on the left edge of the grid will
select/deselect heads in the whole row depending on the current
selection state of the heads.

Clicking on a blank space at the bottom edge of the grid will select the
whole column regardless of the current state of selection of the heads.

Clicking on a blank space at the right edge of the grid will deselect
the whole row regardless of the current state of selection of the heads.

Clicking within the grid on a blank space that is adjacent to a head
will have the same effect as above – but only for all the heads directly
adjacent to each other. As it is possible that the blank space that is
clicked on may have more than one adjacent head, the priority is left,
top, right, bottom.

For other plans where head numbers are packed into the grid with no
blank spaces – e.g. LED arrays, it is still possible to use this method
but the grid must have blank spaces around the edges of the grid.
