== Using MagicQ on PCs and Macs

The MagicQ software for PCs and Macs has exactly the same features as
the MagicQ console software with support for 64 Universes. All 64
Universes are enabled and can be used. A wide range of 3^rd^ party USB
interfaces are supported on Universe 1.

When MagicQ PC or Mac is installed for the first time, it will show a
window with choices of demo shows.

This window can be hidden on subsequent starts by pressing the "Hide
Options Next Time" button. It can be reactivated by setting the Setup,
View Settings, Windows, Start Mode option to "Choose Demo show".


=== Simple Generic Console

Choosing Simple Generic Console opens MagicQ in Simple View and loads a
Simple 48 Channel Generic Console show file.

In this mode the console simply operates as a 48 channel traditional
theatre console with 48 dimmers patched on Universe 1 at channels 1
through 48.

If a MagicQ Wing, MagicQ Twin DMX Interface or MagicDMX interface is
connected to MagicQ then the 48 channels will be automatically output on
the 1^st^ output.

There are 10 Playback Faders labelled PB1 to PB10. Depending on your
screen resolution you may have a S, > and || button for each fader.
Pressing in the box labelled PB1 to PB10 is the same as pressing the
appropriate S button.

To record a Cue set the faders as required. Then press REC and press the
S button of the Playback fader you wish to record it to.

Press CLEAR to clear the Programmer and retrun the faders to their
defaults.

To record a chase, record multiple Cues to a Playback fader simply
record more than one cue to a Playback fader.

To remove the Cues from a fader press REM and press the S button of the
Playback fader you wish to remove Cues from.

To name a fader press SET and press the S button of the Playback fader
you wish to name. You will be shown a text entry box. Type the name
followed by RETURN.

Multiple pages of faders are supported through the Next Page / Previous
Page buttons.

It is possible to interchange between the Normal and Simple views of the
console by pressing the Norm and Simple buttons in the top right corner
of the Application.


=== Technician Test Fixture

The Techincian Test Fixture mode enables technicians to test a moving
light or other fixture in a very simple way. Simply press the TEST SHOW
soft button and select a fixture and a mode.

A new show will be created using that fixture patched at DMX address 1
on the first Universe. The 48 faders show up to 48 channels of the
fixture. Each fader is named with the attribute name and the values are
set to their default values.

The Playback faders are automatically set up with some useful functions
including Macros for Lamp On, Reset and Lamp Off, Locate and Movement,
Colour, Gobo and Strobe tests.

If a MagicQ Wing, MagicQ Twin DMX Interface or MagicDMX interface is
connected to MagicQ then the fixture will be controlled on the 1^st^
output.

The preset faders can be used to change the values of individual
attributes. Use SHIFT and the faders to make a fine adjustment.


=== Demo Shows

The start up Window gives also gives a choice of a standard Lighting
demo show or a PixelMapping demo show.

Additional demo shows for other fixture types, media servers and
visualisers can be found by going to Setup, View Settings, Load Show and
selecting the demo show folder.

=== Touch View

The Touch View is designed for use with touch screens with buttons that
are sized bigger so that it is easier to select functions. Select Touch
View by pressing Touch or Touch2 in the top right corner of the
Application.


=== Playback mode

MagicQ PC supports a Playback Mode which enables MagicQ to be run in a
pure “Playback” mode. This mode is selected by clicking on the new
Playback mode Icon on the desktop or in the Programs, ChamSys MagicQ PC
menu.

Playback mode is only supported when connected to a MagicQ Wing or
MagicQ USB interface. The MagicQ interface must be connected and powered
on before MagicQ is started in Playback mode.

In Playback mode MagicQ it is not possible to record or make changes to
the show data. MagicQ will not save the show files / status files.
Changes (e.g. change of chase speed) will be lost when the application
is stopped and restarted.

Playback Mode shows a much reduced set of buttons on the screen – only
buttons required for show playback are shown.

In Playback Mode only pages of playbacks that have been programmed are
shown – pressing NEXT PAGE will automatically change to the next
programmed page and will cycle around all programmed pages.


=== MagicQ PC / Mac Restrictions

When MagicQ PC (Windows, Linux or Mac) is not connected to a MagicQ USB
interface or MagicQ USB Wing then a small number of remote and
automation features are restricted and “Demo Mode” is shown in the
titlebar. This does not affect show programming or playback.

The restricted features that are not supported without connection to
MagicQ USB interface or MagicQ Wing are:

* Execute Window full screen
* Scheduled Events
* Remote Control Protocol (serial, or network)
* Web Server editing (viewing is supported)
* Autostarting Playbacks
* Playback Synchronisation
* Multi Programming
* Triggering of playbacks using DMX input
* Mouse control of pan/tilt (only supported when connected to a MagicQ
Wing with encoders)
* iPhone / iPad / Android Remote
* Audio control and playback synchronisation with Winamp

Note that the MagicDMX interface does not lift these restrictions, as
this is a low cost interface intended for learning how to program the
system.
