== Head Editor
The Head Editor is accessed from the Edit Head soft button in the Patch
Window. Making changes modifies the head files stored on the
MaqicQ disc and used for all new shows.

The Head Editor consists of 5 views for modifying data:

* General
* Channels
* Ranges
* Palettes
* Macros

In each of the views new values can be entered using the keypad or
keyboard. New entries can be added to the lists by pressing the Insert
soft button. The top right encoder wheel can be used to modify the item
where the cursor is placed.

The Head Editor will start up with the chosen head - i.e. the last head
you chose for patching. If you have not yet chosen a head then the Head
Editor will be empty.

You can choose the head to edit from within the Head Editor by pressing
the Choose Head button. This has the same effect as the Choose Head
button in the Patch Window - i.e. you are presented with a list of heads
to choose from.

Once you have made modifications to the head you can save the
changes to disc by pressing the SAVE HEAD soft button.

If you wish to create a new head from scratch you can press the
New Head soft button, whilst if you wish to copy an existing head
you can use the Save As soft button.

At any time you can choose a new head - however if you have made
changes, which you have not saved to disc, then you will be prompted
whether you really wish to continue. Continuing will mean that the
changes will be lost unless you already have patched heads of that type
- in which case the patched heads in the show will keep the changes. In
either case, the head file on the disc will not keep the changes.

Press the Patch button to leave the Head Editor and return to the Patch
Window.


=== How Heads are stored in MagicQ

MagicQ stores heads in the show/heads folder.  When you choose a head to use in a
show it loads the head from the disc and stores it in memory.
When you save your show, MagicQ writes a copy of the head into
the show file, ensuring that your show will work even if it is
loaded onto a console which does not have the head files for your chosen heads
installed.

If you load an old show into MagicQ then the heads in use on the
show will be the ones recorded into the show file, not the heads
in the show/heads folder on the MagicQ console. From the Patch Window,
if you choose the head again, edit the head, or patch new
heads of the same head type it will always use the head
stored in the show file – this ensures consistency.

You can update a head stored in a show file with the one stored
in show/heads using the “Reload Head” soft button. In the Head Editor
press the “Reload Head” soft button. The head will be reloaded
from disc and all the patched heads in the show will use the updated
head. Note that it is not possible to reload a head where the
number of channels in the head has been changed.

=== Loading new heads into MagicQ

To update MagicQ with all the latest heads, download the latest
heads files (heads.all and icons.all) from the ChamSys web site
http://www.chamsys.co.uk/[www.chamsys.co.uk]. Copy the heads.all file
into the show/heads folder and copy the icons.all file into the
show/icons folder. Then restart MagicQ (SHIFT + RESET in Setup Window).

To load a single head into MagicQ, simply copy the head
file (myhead.hed) into the heads folder.

The console generates an index of heads whenever it is restarted
if new heads have been added. To force the index file to be
regenerated, go to File Manager and press SHIFT + RECREATE INDEX. New
heads should then appear in Patch.


=== Modifying existing heads

Existing heads can be modified by simply making changes and pressing
SAVE. Note however that these changes will be lost if you change
software version as this loads the latest head libraries. If
there are genuine errors in the head then please let us know so
that we can update our libraries.

The heads in the ChamSys library are protected to avoid
accidental changes to them – MagicQ prompts the user before allowing
changes to the heads. In the Head Editor, original ChamSys
heads are indicated by an “LO” in the tile bar. If the
head has been edited it will only show “L”.

If you wish to modify an existing head then you should save it as
a new type or new mode.

The easiest way to make a new head is to use SAVE AS to save as a
new name. The new name used will automatically update the Manufacturer
Name, Short Name and Mode fields.

So, for example to make a modification to the Martin Mac500 Mode 1
head choose the head then press SAVE AS and enter the new
name.

Martin_Mac500_mymode


=== Removing old heads

It is possible to remove all old heads (and all user created heads) by pressing SHIFT and REMOVE HEADS in the File Manager.
This removes all old heads and extracts the heads again from heads.all.
Make sure all your user created heads are backed up to USB or to another system before removing all old heads.


=== General View

The General View contains a fixed number of parameters. Note that as
these parameters fundamentally affect the programming of the head they
can not be modified once a head of the type has been patched.

image:images/headeditgeneral.png[image]

==== Names

The Manufacturer Name, Short Name and Mode are used to identify the head
to the system. These fields should be unique to the moving light. If you
make a new head for a fixture based on one of the standard ones then you should make sure you change the mode to a name of your choice.

The Short Name and Mode are used in display windows where there is not
much space. You should ensure that these names are as short as possible
and do not contain any spaces - preferably less than 8 characters.

The Head Description contains details of the type of head – and is used
for informational purposes.

The WYSIWYG and Capture patch information names indicate the names of
this fixture in WYSIWYG and Capture to enable patch transfer from these
visualisers.

==== DMX

Num Of Chans sets the number of channels for the head.

DMX Min, DMX Max and DMX Offset specify constraints on where the Head
can be patched within the 512 DMX channels.  Changing the Num of Chans will automatically change DMX Max.

==== Params

Pan Range and Tilt Range are used in visualisation and by the FLIP function.

Pan Invert and Tilt Invert.  These are used by the visualiser to specify which direction the yoke/beam moves.

Pan Speed, Tilt Speed

Zoom Narrow and Zoom Wide are used by the visualiser to specify the angle of the beam.  For heads without a zoom set both Zoom Narrow and Zoom Wide to the angle of the beam.

Slowest Strobe, Fastest Strobe, Slowest Rot Speed, Fastest Rotate Speed are used by the visualiser.

==== Options

Moving Head can be Mirror or Yoke - press ENTER to swap.

Colour Mix controls the colour mixing channels – the options are CMY,
RGB, HSI, RGBA and RGBAW.

The default configuration is for heads with CMY colour mixing – i.e. the when the
Cyan channel is at 100% and the Magenta and Yellow channels are at 0%
you get Cyan. If your head uses RGB colour mixing – i.e. the above
combination gives Red – then set the CMY Invert option.

HSI is not used at the moment.

For RGBW fixtures use RGBA.

Virtual Chans. Some heads such as the Generic Scroller2chan are
set up as a “Virtual” head – i.e. the channels in the head
can be patched to any location on MagicQ – unlike normal heads
where the channels are sequential from the DMX start address. In the
View DMX view, the DMX address fields are used to specify the addresses
for each channel in the virtual head – up to a maximum of 5
channels. (For normal heads these fields are used to specify
multiple fixtures patched to one head.) Virtual heads could be
used for other irregular fixtures such as water jet controls.

Virtual Dim. Used for heads with no Dimmer channel to force a virtual dimmer to be patched for each head.

Dimmer curve specifies the dimmer curve to be used for Intensity
channels.

Framing type is used to specify the framing (shuttering) type.

MQTrack is specific to MagicQ tracking systems and is only used by MagicQ inbuilt head files.

==== Multi

The Multiple Heads Type and subsequent fields refer to Heads
with multiple elements – see the section Heads With Multiple
Elements below.


==== Media

This section is used to automatically set media server options when a
media server layer is patched. When a heady with these settings is
patched, MagicQ adds a new entry in Setup, View System, View Media based
on these parameters.


=== Channels View

This view allows the different channels of the head to be specified. Note
that once a head of the type has been patched it is not possible to
change the number of channels of the head.

image:images/headeditchannels.png[image]

Channels can be added using the Insert soft button and deleted using the
Remove Button (press twice to Remove).

The Name field can be used to name the individual channel.  If no name is specified then MagicQ will use the name of the attribute that it is assigned to.

The Type field is used to indicate whether the channel is Highest Takes Precedence (HTP) or Latest Takes Precedence (LTP).  Generally only Intensity is set to HTP - all other channels are LTP.  Note that if a head has combined Dimmer and Strobe channel then this should be set as Dimmer attribute with type of HTP.

The Attrib No field is used to identify the function of the channel to MagicQ.  This is the most important field in the channel list.

|============

The Enc field specifies which encoder position in the Intensity, Colour, Position, Beam windows the attribtue appears on.  The Enc field is defaulted based on the choice of Attrib No - this provides a common interface across all heads.  In some circumstances users may wish to modify the allocated encoder in order to bring similar attributes onto the same page.

The encoders are positioned as follows:

|===
|Encoder A|Encoder E
|Encoder B|Encoder F
|Encoder C|Encoder Y
|Encoder D|Encoder X
|===

There is one page each for Intensity, Position and Colour and five pages for Beam.


The Size field is used to specify the size of the attribute.  For channels that are only 8 bit the Size field is set to 8 Bit.  For 16bit channels the coarse channel is set to 16 bit Hi and the fine channel to 16 bit Lo.  For channels with 24 bit resolution set the lower two channels as for 16 bit and the highest channel to 24 Bit Hi.

The Instant field specifies whether a channel by default snaps
immediately to new values rather than fading – this is useful for colour
wheels and gobo wheels where you want immediate changes.

The Slow Encoder field makes the encoder works more slowly than normal.
This is good for attributes where every possible DMX value represents a
different function and therefore only very small turns of the encoder
are required to change function.

The Default field defines what value the channel is set to by default on
start-up. When the Setup, Programming option “Unused chans return to
default” is set then channels also return to these values when they are
no longer controlled by Playbacks or the Programmer.

The Locate field defines what value the channel is set to when a Locate
is performed on the head – it is also used as the default value for a
channel if no default values is specified.

The Default and Locate should specify the normal defaults for the
fixture – the exact values used in a particular show can be overriden by
making a Default Cue or Locate Cue in the Cue Store.

The Highlight and Lowlight values are used when the Setup, Programming
option Highlight mode is set to Advanced. This enables the user to
configure custom highlight/lowlight settings for each type of
head.


=== Ranges View

image:images/headeditranges.png[image]

This view defines the ranges for channels that use specific values
to access functions such as colour and gobo wheels, shutter channels and
control channels. Ranges can be set up at any time regardless of whether
heads of the type have been patched.  The range data becomes
immediately available.  If the head has been patched then you can capture
the minimum and maximum value fields from the programmer.

Ranges can be added using the Insert soft button and deleted using the
Remove Button (press twice to Remove).

For each range you specify the channel number (starting at 1), the range type, the range name
and the minimum and maximum DMX values for the range. The minimum and maximum values can be the same value if required.

The range type field is used to specify the function of this range so that MagicQ can recognise the features of the head. The range
types are particularly used in visualisation.

The Auto Palette field indicates whether the range can be used to build
Palettes. When a Head has no Palettes specified for a particular channel
then it can try and generate them from the range information. Up to 20
Auto Palettes are supported per channel. Set this value to 1 for a
specific channel function such as a Cone Gobo on a gobo wheel or a
larger value for a graded parameter such as the rotate speed on a Gobo
Rotate channel. The sum of all the Auto Palette fields for a particular
channel should not exceed 20.

The Icon field is the icon displayed in the relevant Windows and soft
buttons.

The Dep Chan and Dep Val fields enable ranges to depend on other ranges.
This enables ranges to be defined for heads with attributes that change
their function depending on the value of another attribute – such as FX
parameters that depend on the particular FX chosen. The range is only
valid when the dependent channel (Dep Chan) is set to the range
specified in the dependent value (Dep val).

==== Importing Ranges

Ranges can be imported from a .csv format file using the Import Ranges
button. The data should be organised in the .csv file in the same column
order as the fields in MagicQ.

<chan>,<name>,<min>,<max>,<auto pal>,<icon>,<dep chan>,<dep val>


==== Capturing Ranges

To capture the minimum and maximum values from the programmer you must
first insert a new range and select the channel number you are
interested in. Then using the Group, Position, Colour, Beam, windows in
the usual way set the minimum value for the attribute. Back in the
Ranges View, move the cursor to the minimum field and then press the
Capture Range soft button. In a similar way, set up the maximum value in
the programmer, move to the maximum field in the Ranges View, and then
press the Capture Range soft button.


==== Attribute Test

The “Attr test” mode enables the range to be tested on any patched heads
of this type. In this mode moving up/down outputs the Range to all
patched heads of this type. The value output is the middle point between
the minimum and maximum – except when the cursor is placed in the
minimum or maximum fields – in which case the actual minimum or maximum
value is output.


=== Palettes View

This view defines the default palettes that are loaded when the head is
patched. Palettes can be set up at any time regardless of whether heads
of the type have been patched. The palette data is immediately available
for patching new heads. When you have changed Palettes in the Head
Editor you can regenerate palettes for heads that are already patched by
using the “Regen Palettes” soft button.

image:images/headeditpalettes.png[image]

For each Palettes you specify the type (press Enter to swap between the
types), the name and the number of channels that make up the Palette.
Then for each channel you specify the channel number and the level for
that channel.

Palettes can be added using the Insert soft button and deleted using the
Remove Button (press twice to Remove).

The Icon field is the icon displayed in the relevant Windows and soft
buttons.


==== Importing Palettes

Palettes can be imported from a .csv format file using the Import Ranges
button. The data should be organised in the .csv file in the same column
order as the fields in MagicQ.

<palette type>,<name>,<num of chans>,<icon>,<chan 1>,<val 1>,<chan
2>,<val2>,…


==== Capturing Palettes

To capture the palette value fields from the programmer you must first
insert a new palette and configure the channel numbers you are
interested in. Then using the Group, Focus, Colour, Beam windows in the
usual way set up the palette values. Back in the Palettes View press the
Capture Palette soft button.


==== Attribute Test

The “Attr test” mode enables the palette to be tested on any patched
heads of this type. In this mode moving up/down outputs the Palette to
all patched heads of this type.


=== Macros View

This view defines the macros that are available to control special
features of the head such as turning the lamp on and off and resetting
motor channels. Every head should have a macro named “Lamp On”,
“Reset” and “Lamp Off”. MagicQ uses these macros in short cut keys for
these functions.

image:images/headeditmacro.png[image]

Each macro has a name and a number of channels. Up to 10 channels can be
controlled by each macro.

The macro data consists of fields to specify which channels are used (C1
to C10) and then the macro step data. The macro step data consists of
the number of steps followed by data fields.

The number of steps indicates how many steps are required in the macro –
normally there are just two steps – the initial step to set the correct
levels and hold them for a time (e.g. 5 seconds) and then a step that
returns the channels to their default values.

The step data is specified in the fields D1…Dx. For each step there is a
time for the step, followed by the values for each of the channels used
for the step.

=== User Icons

It is possible to load user icons from bitmap and jpeg files. In File
Manager click on the .png or.bmp files you wish to make into icons. The
icons will appear under the “User icons” icon class.

User icons are not stored in the show file, so when changing MagicQ systems it will be necessary to load the user icons onto
each MagicQ console / MagicQ PC system. We would be pleased to add any
user icons to the main icon library – please send them to
mailto:support@chamsys.co.uk[support@chamsys.co.uk].


=== Heads with multiple elements

MagicQ includes support for heads with multiple elements (e.g.
RGB pixels), so that they can be patched in one action rather than
patching the individual elements separately. When these fixtures are
patched they continue to be controlled as separate heads with all the
associated benefits. The head simply contains a count of the
number of elements.

image:images/headeditmulti.png[image]

Heads that consist of a single general element in addition to a
repeated element are also supported. In these cases two different
heads are required – one for the general element and one for the
repeated element. The head for the general element is used for
patching, and it references the repeated element to enable it to be
patched automatically. It is possible to set the Multiple Heads Type
field to specify whether the repeated elements are patched before or
after the general element.

In the Patch Window, View Heads only the head general element is shown – however testing, moving, copying and setting the head
no, affects all the elements in the head. The View Chans view
continues to show the individual channels.

Heads with multiple elements can be inserted into the grid in one go.
The Width, Height and Order fields in the head specify how the
repeated elements are arranged – for example the picture below shows
Color Web 125 inserted into a grid. Color Web 125 has a strange DMX
order with individual elements having a “L” shape rather than a square
or rectangular shape.

image:images/outputscolorweb.png[image]

It is possible to swap the repeated elements of a multiple element head
around using the Swap field in the View Heads view. This is very useful,
if for instance a LED batten has been rigged upside down.

When a head containing multiple elements is patched, a different
head number will be allocated to each element. This enables each
individual element to be controlled from the keypad and from the grid
views. For heads that consist of a general element and repeated elements
the general element will be allocated the base head number and the
repeated elements will have increasing head numbers from the base
element.

The Head Editor now shows the full channel list in View Chans including
the repeated channels.

==== Patching Heads with Duplicated attributes

From versiosn 1.6.6.2 MagicQ has improved support for Heads with more than one element of an attribute - for example a LED Wash light with 5 RGB elements or a club light with 2 tilt channels.  Heads set as "Duplicated" now allow access to the individual elements and allow FX to be run over the individual elements.  

By default the duplicated elements are treated as one element - so the  2nd, 3rd and 4th elements just copy the programming from the 1st element.  This ensures that the Head is simple to use and appears to act as if it only had a single element.

When locating, selecting palettes and using soft buttons or encoders on attribute parameters only the first element is made active in the programmer and therefore only the first element is recorded into Cues.  When the Cues are played back then MagicQ copies the calculated values from the 1st element to the other elements.

Individual elements can be selected using the dot (.) operator.  For example to select the 1st element only, enter .1 NEXT HEAD or .1 @@. This sub selects only the 1st element.  Pressing returns the selection to all elements.  When a sub selection is active on a Duplicated Head then the specific elements will be made active in the Programmer and subsequently recorded into Cues.  When the Cues are played back MagicQ uses the programming from the Cue for elements that have been recorded in to the Cue, only copying for elements that have not been recorded.

Palettes values are created only for the first element.  When a sub selection is in operation MagicQ will use the value in the Palette for the first element regardless of the element selected - this avoids the need for creating separate palette information for each element.  When a Palette is updated it will update Cues that use that Palette from the data for the 1st element regardless of which element is active in the Cue - ensuring that the Cue gets updated as expected.

When selecting FX for channels on a Duplicated Head that have multiple elements MagicQ prompts three options for applying the FX:

* Dup Elements
* Include Elements
* Use Elements

Dup Elements treats the elements as duplicated - i.e. all elements in the head do exactly the same thing.  This is the default operation which treats all the elements in a head as one.  In software prior to v1.6.5.8 this was the only supported mdoe of FX for Duplicated Heads.

Include Elements includes all the elements in the FX enabling separate control of each of the elements as if they were separate heads.  For example if you apply a FX to 4 heads each with 3 elements then the FX would be spread over the 12 elements.

Use Elements runs the FX within the Heads, with all Heads performing the same FX synchronously across their elements.  This is the same as Include Elements except that MagicQ automatically sets Parts to the number of elements within the heads causing all Heads to have the same offset.

Heads are set as Duplicated Heads in the Multiple Heads Type field in the Head Editor.  In the Head Editor, View Chans the element field (cursor right) is used to indicate the different elements.  Duplicated elements always start from Element 1.  All elements that are not duplicated are set to 0 (Main Element).  For heads that have both a main element and a repeated element - e.g. a master RGB and then repeated RGB for each element then the master RGB is element 0 and the repeated RGBs start from 1.
