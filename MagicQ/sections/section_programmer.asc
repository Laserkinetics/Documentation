== Programmer
The programmer is the function of MagicQ where show data is
configured for recording. The programmer takes priority over all
playbacks. It can also be used during live running to override the
outputs – for example, for changing the colour or gobo of intelligent
heads.

MagicQ outputs any channels that are active in the programmer at
highest priority – i.e. they over-ride all other playbacks.

=== What is in the programmer?

The Prog Window enables you to determine exactly what is in the
programmer and how it is configured. Press PROG to open the window. The
programmer stores three types of data

* Channel Levels
* Channel Times
* Channel FX

In the Prog Window there are three views, corresponding to the three
types of data – View Levels, View Times and View FX. Use the three top
left soft buttons to select the view.

In the Channel Times and Channel View windows you have a choice of a
Simple View or an Advanced View. The Simple View is sufficient for most
programming – it enables modifications of fade times on a per attribute
type basis and modifications of each programmed FX. The Advanced View
enables fade times and FX parameters to be set up on a per channel
basis.

In Levels View select Advanced View to view the raw values rather than
the palette/range names.

The LED on the CLEAR button is illuminated when there is data in the
programmer.

A second copy of the Programmer Window, the Programmer Info Window can
be opened for displaying on an external monitor. Press CTRL + Prog to
open the Programmer Info Window.


=== Clearing the programmer

image:images/progcleared.png[image]

To clear the Programmer press CLEAR. All channels will be deactivated and
all HTP channels will be set to zero. It is possible to force all LTP
channels to zero by using CTRL CLEAR.

Pressing SHIFT CLEAR clears the heads that you have currently selected.
Use this to clear one or more heads without clearing all heads from the
programmer.

To clear the programmer over a period of time, type a number before
pressing CLEAR, e.g. Press 5 CLEAR to clear the programmer over 5
seconds.


=== Activation by Channel or by Head?

After CLEAR has been pressed, the programmer is empty - i.e. there are
no channels active in the programmer. When the level of a dimmer channel
or an attribute of an intelligent head is changed for the first time
then it becomes active in the programmer.

For heads with multiple channels, there is a choice here as to how the
other attributes of a head are affected by the activation of one of the
head attributes.

By default, if one attribute of a head is changed then only that
attribute is activated - this is referred to as "Activation by Chan".
This can be modified in the Setup Window in the “Activate chans/head”
option. When set to "head" then when one attribute of a head is changed,
all the attributes of the head are activated. For LTP channels the
values of the attributes in the programmer are set to the current output
value. HTP channels will remain at zero.

MagicQ also supports “IPCB”, “IPC” and “Col”. These group similar
parameters together, so for example if you touch a colour attribute or
the colour attributes are loaded into the programmer. “IPCB” means all
Intensity, Position, Colour and Beam attributes work in this way,
whereas “IPC” only works on Intensity, Position and Colour attributes,
not Beam attributes.

Performing a LOCATE activates all parameters. At any time all of the
attributes of the selected heads can be forced into the programmer by
opening the Programmer Window, holding SHIFT and pressing ACTIVE.


=== Recording a Cue

The basic unit of storage on the console is the Cue, which stores

* Level information
* Timing information
* FX information

This corresponds to the information in the programmer - recording a Cue
is simply a matter of transferring what is in the programmer into the
Cue.

To record a Cue, first set up the look, then press RECORD and press the
SELECT button of the Playback to record the Cue onto.

To name the Cue, key in the name before pressing RECORD. You can name a
Cue that has already been recorded by keying in the name, pressing SET
and pressing the Select button for the Playback that the Cue was
recorded onto.

To test the Cue, first clear the programmer by pressing CLEAR then raise
the Playback fader or press the Playback FLASH button.

When a Cue is recorded it is automatically added to the Cue Store - a list of all Cues stored in the show. The Cue will be given a
unique Cue Number (e.g. Q1). This enables the Cue to be re-used in
future programming.

To view a recorded Cue, press the SELECT button for the Playback, and
then press CUE to open the Cue Window.

The Cue Window is very similar to the Programmer Window - it has the
same views for Levels, Timing and FX.


==== Levels

All active channels in the programmer are transferred into the Cue. Thus
if "Activation by Head" is in use then all the attributes of activated
heads will be stored.

If the channel level was set using a Palette, then that is also recorded
so that the Cue can keep track of changes to the Palette. When you
subsequently change the Palette the changes will be reflected in the
Cue.


==== Timing

The timing information in the programmer is copied into the Cue. Cue
timing can be set up before or after the Cue is recorded.

Timing information for channels consists of two types:

General Times: stored for each type of attribute (Int In, Int Out,
Position, Colour, Beam)

Individual Times: stored on an individual channel basis

All Cues have General Times whereas Individual Times are optional. When
a Cue has Individual Times then these override the General Times. Cues
can have Individual Times set for only certain heads or attributes – in
this case Individual Times will be used for those heads and attributes,
whilst the General Times will be used for all other heads and
attributes.

==== FX

The Cue stores FX information for each of the FX that is in the
programmer.


=== Split Cue Times

It is possible to add Split Cue times (different times for different
heads) both before a Cue is programmed in the Programmer Window and
afterwards in the Cue Window.

Split times can be added by playing back Palettes with time or by
directly editing the Times in the Programmer or Cue Windows.

In both the Programmer and the Cue Window the View Times has two views –
View Simple and View Advanced. View Simple is used for simple changes to
times including entering split times across the selected heads. View
Advanced is used for editing attribute times for a particular head one
by one.

==== View Simple

The View Simple shows both General Times and Individual Times. The
General Times are the times that are applied by default to attributes in
the Cue – i.e. if you do not specify any Individual Time for an
attribute on a head then the General Times will be used. The Individual
Times lets you enter times for specific heads and for specific
attributes.

image:images/progtimes.png[image]

If you select some heads selected then the Individual Times will show
you the times for those heads otherwise it will show times for all heads
in the Cue. If heads have different then the lowest and highest times
are shown.

You can set split times in the Individual Times by selecting some heads
and entering the shortest time followed by THRU and then the longest
time. For instance, if you enter 4 THRU 8 in the fade field then it will
set a fade times from 4 seconds to 8 seconds across the selected heads.
The order is determined by the current order within the selected heads –
you can change the selection order from the Group Window.

Using the Next Head, Prev Head displays the times for individual heads
so you can step through each of the heads in turn to see their times.
Use All to get back to the summary for all selected heads.

It is possible to set individual times on a per attribute view – but you
must have some heads selected for this to work.

Use Remove to remove delay and fade times from heads – the times will be
removed and MagicQ will use the General Times for these heads.


==== View Advanced

In the View Advanced you can set delay and fade times on a per head and
per attribute basis one at a time. It is also possible to set multiple
heads and multiple attributes by highlighting multiple items using SHIFT
and the cursor keys. Fan also works in this view – but note that the
order of fanning is fixed to the order used in the Patch Window. To fan
in alternate orders use the View Simple view.

=== Fade Type

It is possible to specify the fade type in both the Programmer Window
and Cue Window in the View Times, View Simple view.

* Default – fades according to Instant attribute in Personality
* Fade – always fades
* Snap at start – always snaps at beginning of fade
* Snap at end – always snaps at end of fade


=== Recording to a specific Cue Id

To Record to a specific Cue Id in a Cue Stack, enter the Cue Id number
on the keypad before you press RECORD and select the Playback S button.

It is also possible when the Setup option “Select Heads and Palettes
from keypad” is set to record Cues using only the keypad.

Press Record + Enter to record directly to the currently selected
Playback. You can record to a specific Cue Id on the currently selected
playback by entering a number and pressing Record + Enter.

You can record to a specific Cue Id and Playback by entering the
Playback number followed by /, followed by the Cue Id and pressing
Record + Enter.

For example 6/2.0 ENTER records to Playback 6, Cue Id 2.0.

=== Snapshot Icons

MagicQ stores Snapshot images of the Visualisation, Media or Pixel Mapping output when recording Cues and Palettes enabling easy identification of the contents of Cues and Palettes.  MagicQ grabs Snapshots directly from MagicVis and MagicHD.  MagicQ can also grab Snapshots from Capture using CITP and from MSEX compliant Media Servers.  Snapshots are stored into extended show files which can be transferred between consoles.

MagicQ will only store snapshot icons when the relevant Visualiser / Media Server is active and connected.


=== Record Options

Record options can be accessed when recording by pressing SHIFT and
RECORD or at any time using the REC OPTIONS soft button in the
Programmer Window.

image:images/recordoptionswindow.png[image]

==== Record Short cuts

There are many short-cuts keys for recording

Record Merge
|===
|Hold S and press REC|Record Merge into Current Cue on Playback
|REC 0 ENTER|Record Merge into Current Cue on Playback
|REC UPDATE|Record Merge into Current Cue on Playback
|Hold + and press REC|Record Merge (then choose where to merge)
|Hold – and press REC|Record Remove (then choose where to record)
|===

Record Cue Only
|===
|Hold / and press REC|Record cue only (then choose where to record)
|===

Record selected heads only
|===
|Hold * and press REC|Record selected heads only
|Hold * and + and press REC|Record merge selected heads only
|Hold * and - and press REC|Record remove selected heads only
|===

==== Masking

The console supports comprehensive masking facilities to enable the
operator to select which attributes are recorded from the programmer
into Cues.

By default there is no masking applied - all channels in the programmer
are recorded into Cues. Two types of masking can be applied - masking by
attribute type and masking by attribute.

Masking by attribute type enables the operator to select which of the
intensity, position, colour and beam attribute types is recorded. Press
the REC INT, REC POS, REC COL and REC BEAM soft buttons to select the
attribute types to be recorded.

Select attributes in the Record Options Window to select to record
individual attributes into the Cue.

Select Entire State to record all the values in the Programmer
regardless of whether they have been changed since the last Cue was
record – this forces a blocking Cue to be recorded with hard values. Use
ALL + RECORD as a shortcut to select Entire State.

The Status Display indicates when any masking is active. Masking is
cleared once a Cue is recorded - this can be prevented by pressing the
LOCK MASK soft button in the Record Options Window.

The Record Option Window displays individual attribute names based on
the currently selected head so that it is easy to recognise the
attributes to select. If no heads are currently selected then it uses
the first active head in the programmer.

Masking can be selected quickly by holding Intensity, Position, Beam or
Colour and pressing RECORD for recording only the selected attributes.


==== Options

The console supports several additional options for recording Cues.
These include recording all the channels from heads regardless of
whether they are active in the programmer and recording only heads that
are currently selected. Press the REC OPTIONS soft button and select an
option.

Record options return to the defaults once a Cue is recorded.


=== Active

MagicQ has an Active function for loading attributes into the programmer
at their current value. This can be used to ensure that the programmer
contains all the attributes of the selected heads, or to add in
individual attributes to the programmer.

To make individual attributes active in the programmer, hold SET and
press the soft button associated with the attribute in the Intensity,
Position, Colour, Beam windows.

It is also possible to make active entire Intensity, Position, Colour or
Beam attributes by holding Position, Colour or Beam or Intensity and
pressing SET.

To make all the attributes of a group of heads active, first select the
heads you want to control, then hold * and press SET. Alternatively in
the Programmer Window press SHIFT and select ACTIVE.


=== Removing channels from the Programmer

==== Removing channels using the REMOVE button

To remove (knock out) items from the programmer.

* Select the heads you wish to remove attributes from. If no heads are
selected then all active heads in the programmer are affected.

Then choose one of the following methods

* Hold REMOVE and press All, Position, Colour, Beam. This removes all
attributes of these of Intensity, Position, Colour or Beam.
* Hold REMOVE and turn an encoder wheel or press the soft button in the
Beam, Colour, Position or Group windows – the specified attribute will
be removed.
* Hold All, Position, Colour or Beam and press REMOVE. This removes all
attributes of these of Intensity, Position, Colour or Beam.
* Hold a soft button in the Beam, Colour, Position or Group windows and
press REMOVE. The specified attribute will be removed.
* Hold * and press REMOVE to remove all attributes of the selected
heads.



==== Removing channels using the Programmer Window

It is also possible to remove attributes from the programmer by editing
the spread sheet view in the Programmer Window.

Select the item (s) with the cursor that you wish to remove from the
programmer and then press the REMOVE soft button.

For example, to remove the iris attributes for all heads in the
programmer:

* Select VIEW LEVELS in the Prog View.
* Select the entire Iris column (move to the top, hold SHIFT and press
END)
* Press the REMOVE ATTR soft button.

To remove, all of the attributes of MAC500 head numbers 2 and 3 from the
programmer:

* Select VIEW LEVELS in the Prog View.
* Move the cursor to the Head Name column.
* Select MAC500s 2 and 3 (move to the row for number 2, hold SHIFT, move
to row for number 3)
* Press the REMOVE HEAD soft button.

To remove, the FX for head number 2:

* Select VIEW LEVELS in the Prog View.
* Select ADV VIEW.
* Move the cursor to the Head Name column for Mac number 2.
* Press the REMOVE HEAD FX soft button.


=== Copy between heads

You can copy between heads using the keypad. To copy the head data,
select some heads from the keypad, press COPY and then enter the
destination heads. For example, to copy from heads 1 to 2 to heads 5 to
8

1 THRU 2 COPY 5 THRU 8 ENTER

Selected attributes can be copied rather than the entire head, by using
SHIFT + COPY instead of COPY and setting the attribute mask. Both levels
and FX are copied between the heads.

It is not necessary to have the same number of source heads as
destination heads. Each of the source heads is used in turn to copy data
to the destination heads.


=== Blind programming

A show can be programmed without affecting the state of the outputs
using blind programming mode. In this mode the programmer will operate
as normal (with the current levels being displayed in the Prog Window)
but the contents of the programmer will not be output.

Enter and exit blind mode by pressing the BLIND button. The button
illuminates to indicate blind mode is active and BLIND is indicated in
the status display.

Blind mode is also useful during playback for busking in FX. For example
you might wish to set up a FX on some moving heads using blind mode –
configuring the speed and size before you make it live.

You can enter and exit blind mode with times. For example, press 10
BLIND to enter blind mode over 10 seconds.


=== Parking (freezing) channels

It is possible to park (freeze) channels using the PARK soft button in
the Group Window. Press SHIFT + PARK to unpark channels.

All attributes of selected heads that are in the programmer are
parked/unparked. To make all the attributes of the selected heads
active, go to the Programmer Window and press SHIFT and ACTIVE.

Parking persists over shutdowns and resets. Parking information
is stored in the show file.

Parking forces HTP values to the parked value regardless of other
playbacks (In Group window, SHIFT + ACTIVE).
