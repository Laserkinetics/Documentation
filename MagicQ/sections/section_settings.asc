== Settings
MagicQ supports a large number of settings that the user is
free to change. These settings are divided into two categories – show
settings and console settings. Show settings are settings that the user
may wish to change on a show by show basis, whereas console settings are
associated with the specific console and its connectivity to external
devices.

.Show Settings
* Mode Settings (not Product & Country)
* Keypad & Encoder Settings
* Windows Settings
* Programming Settings
* Playback Settings
* Cue Stack Settings
* Cue Storage Settings
* Media Server Settings

.Console Settings
* DMX I/O Settings
* Wing Settings
* Monitor Settings
* Mode Settings (Product and Country)
* Network Settings
* MIDI/SMPTE Settings
* Port Settings
* Multi Console Settings
* Hardware Settings

Both show settings and console settings are stored in MagicQ show files,
but by default only show settings are loaded when a MagicQ show is
loaded. To force consoles settings to be loaded as well use SHIFT and
LOAD SHOW+CON.


=== Programming Mode

The MagicQ console allows the programming mode and playback mode to be
configured in the Setup Window. The modes control several of the
different settings of the console. All of the settings can be configured
individually – however, the modes make it easy to change between the
most frequently used settings.

The programming mode determines how the console is programmed. The
options are Normal, Theatre non-track, Theatre tracking and Hog II Warp.
Most users will choose Normal.

Changing mode during programming does not change Cue Stacks that have
already been programmed – it only affects the programming of new Cue
Stacks.

The setting affected by changing mode are:

.Setup, Prog Settings

|=======================
|Setting|Normal(live)|Theatre non track|Theatre Track|Hog II warp
|HTP in, HTP out, Pos times|0s|3s|3s|3s
|=======================

For changing between tracking and non-tracking mode simply change the
“Programmer Tracking” setting in the Setup Window, “Prog” tab. This
automatically sets the Default Cue Stack options (Recalculate state on
jumps, Zero old HTP, Zero old FX) correctly.

=== Playback Mode

The playback mode determines how the console plays back cues. The
options are Normal and Safe. In Normal mode the user can make changes
during playback just like when they were programming the show. In Safe
mode, making changes is not allowed and backups are turned off to any
possible interference with the running of the show.


=== Output Settings

The console universes can be configured to use different protocols.
Outputs must be configured and enabled before the console will output
data. To set up outputs, open the Setup Window and select the VIEW DMX
I/O view.

MagicQ software supports 64 universes but older versions of MagicQ
support less universes. To change the number of universes in operation
please see <<_configuring_number_of_universes,Configuring number of
universes>>.


==== Configuring Output Universes

For each of the universes, the output and input protocol can be selected
in the Out Type and In Type fields respectively. Press ENTER or double
click to change to the next protocol type.

image:images/dmxio.png[image]

The possible protocols are

.DMX I/O Out Protocols
|=======================
|None|No protocol
|Art-Net|Art-Net, Art-Net II and Art-Net III protocols (over Ethernet)
|Pathport|Pathport protocol (over Ethernet)
|Show Net|Show net protocol (over Ethernet)
|ACN |ACN Streaming DMX (over Ethernet)
|MQ Direct Direct|DMX outputs from MagicQ Pro and Expert consoles
|MQ Wing|DMX outputs on MagicQ PC wing, Mini Wing or Maxi Wing
|MQ Dual DMX|MagicQ Dual DMX interfaces
|MagicDMX|ChamSys MagicDMX USB interface
|Enttec Pro|Enttec Pro dongle
|Dig Enlight|Digital Enlightenment dongles
|Peperoni|Peperoni dongles and devices
|DMX4ALL|DMX4ALL devices
|USBDMX|USBDMX devices
|Velleman|Velleman K8062
|Nicholaudie|Nicholaudie / Sunlight devices
|=======================

MagicQ supports 3^rd^ party DMX dongles but cannot guarantee their
performance. – these devices are supported on Universe 1 only. Note that
some of these devices rely on the PC to do the DMX framing and therefore
results may be unpredictable on some systems. Many of these devices are
unable to transmit full DMX frames at the full DMX refresh rate.

MagicQ Dual DMX modules, MagicDMX interfaces and SnakeSys Ethernet to DMX Interfaces use their own internal processor to
ensure correct DMX framing at high DMX refresh rates.

For network protocols such as Art-Net and Pathport it is
necessary to set up the Out Uni and In Uni fields - these determine
which the ID of the Universe when carried over Ethernet. These need to
be set up to match the Ids configured on the Ethernet Interface boxes.

Where large numbers of universes are being carried over Ethernet it may
also be necessary to configure the Art-Net subnet ids. Enter subnet ids
using the syntax 1-0 for subnet 1 universe 0. The subnet ids default to
0.

A ! by a Universe indicates a clash whereby more than one Universe is
being output on the same network Universes.


==== Using Art-Net II

To use Art-Net II simply configure the Output Universe type to Art-Net
and then set the following options:

Each Universe on MagicQ can be set to Unicast to a specific IP address
rather than broadcast as in Art-Net I. The IP addresses of Art-Net
compliant devices on the network can be viewed in Setup Window, View
System, View Status, Art-Net nodes.


==== SnakeSys T2/B4/R4/R8/ChamSys Ethernet Interface

The SnakeSys B4 and SnakeSys R4 support four DMX output universes. The SnakeSys T2 supports two DMX output universes whilst the R8 supports eight DMX output universes.
original ChamSys Ethernet Interface supported three DMX output universes,

To use a SnakeSys interface that is set for ArtNet on ArtNet Universe
0-0 (both rotary switches set to 0) set the first 4 universes in Setup,
DMX I/O to Out Type of Art-Net, and In Type of Art-Net and enable them.
For the simplest operation, set the Out Uni and the In Uni for Universe
1 to 0, for Universe 2 to 1 and Universe 3 to 2, and Universe 4 to 3.


==== MagicQ Consoles Direct Outputs

All current MagicQ consoles have four direct DMX outputs on the rear
panel.

By default MagicQ consoles are set to output the first 4 console
universes on the direct console outputs.

If the setting “Setup, View Settings, Ports, MagicQ Wings & Interfaces”
is set to “Yes (auto DMX)” then the first 4 universes will output
regardless of whether they are enabled in Setup, View DMX I/O.

If you wish to patch the direct outputs to other than the first four
universes, then set the required universes to “MQ Direct” and set Port
1, Port 2, Port 3 or Port 4. As soon as any of the universes are set to
“MQ Direct” or “Cham USB” then this overrides the default settings.

==== MagicQ Mini/PC/Maxi wing

MagicQ Mini Wing has one DMX output, MagicQ PC Wing and PC Wing Compact have two DMX outputs and the MagicQ MAxiWing has four DMX outputs.

By default MagicQ is set to output the first universes on the system to the DMX outputs on the MagicQ Mini, PC and Maxi Wing.  For MagicQ Mini Wing Universe 1 will be output from the DMX port, for PC Wing and PC Wing Compact universes 1 and 2 will be output, and on MaxiWing universes 1 to 4 will be output.

If Setup, View Settings, Ports, MagicQ USB Wings & Interfaces
is set to “Yes – auto DMX” then MagicQ will automatically output DMX on
the Wings starting from Universe 1 – provided that none of the Universes
have been explicitly set to “MQ Wing”.

To use different universes, set the required universes to MQ Wing and enable them.  The universes set to MQ Wing will be output to the ports in order.

Note that in an emergency it is also possible to use the MagicQ Mini Wing, PC Wing or Maxi Wing direct DMX
outputs with a MagicQ console – simply connect the MagicQ Wing to the
MagicQ console using a USB cable and set the outputs as above.


==== MagicQ Dual DMX Interfaces

For MagicQ Dual DMX Interfaces select Dual DMX. Then select the module
and port in the Out Uni field. For example, select Mod 1 Port 1 and Mod
1 Port 2 for the two outputs. Any of the universes can be output
to MagicQ Dual DMX interfaces.


==== MagicDMX Interfaces

MagicDMX Interfaces automatically output on universe 1 when Setup, View Settings, Ports, MagicDMX mode is set to DMX Out.

It is possible to set the Out type for Universe 1 to be MagicDMX – this
automatically sets the Setup setting MagicQDMX mode to DMX Out.

It is not necessary to set the Out type for Universe 1 – only the
MagicDMX mode setting.

MagicDMX devices do not need any additional drivers – they use different
HID drivers within the operating system.

Note that the MagicDMX Basic version is limited to 5 hours of continuous
use. When the time is close to expiring warnings will be shown. On
expiry the MagicDMX will send out DMX levels of 0. The MagicDMX Basic
interface must then be unplugged and MagicQ software restarted to use
the device again.

The MagicDMX Basic version only supports DMX Out. The MagicDMX Full
Interface supports both DMX Out and DMX In.

The MagicDMX interfaces do not remove the automation and remote
restrictions when used with MagicQ Software – this requires a MagicQ
Wing, or MagicQ Dual DMX Interface.

==== Testing Output Universes

MagicQ supports some simple options for testing complete output
universes, including sending all ‘0’s, sending all ‘255’s, and several
additional test patterns. Tests can be performed on individual universes
using by selecting the test in the Test field of the Setup Window, DMX
I/O view.

Selecting "Input" automatically routes all 512 input channels received
on the universe to the 512 output channels.  This is useful for loopback and network protocol conversion.

When any of the universes are in test mode a warning flashes in the
Status Display.


==== Copying Output Universes

MagicQ supports copying of entire universes to multiple outputs – this
may be useful where you wish to duplicate an output universe onto
different outputs of an Art-Net box, or you want to set MagicQ wing
outputs to be the same as Ethernet outputs. Select the universe you wish
to copy in the Copy field of the Setup Window, DMX I/O View.

Select the Universe to copy – e.g. Uni 1 for the first Universe. You can
enter the universe number. Enter 0 to turn off copying.

==== Hot take-over

MagicQ supports hot take-over to enable a second console (or MagicQ
PC) to take-over running the show if the first console has a problem. 

When using Net Sessions, then all Hot Takeover fields in DMX I/O should be set to No.

For how to use hot take-over see <<_networking_of_magicq_systems,Using Multiple
Consoles>>.


=== Wing Settings

ChamSys manufacture the following wings that connect to PCs, Macs and consoles
via USB


.Wings
[options="header"]
|=======================
|Product|No of Playbacks|Playback nos.|No of DMX|No of wings supported per PC / console
|Mini Wing|10|Main (1-10)|1|1
|PC Wing|10|Main (1-10)|2|1
|Maxi Wing|10|Main (1-10)|4|1
|Extra Wing|24|1 * Wing Playbacks|None|8
|Playback Wing|24|1 * Wing Playbacks|None|8
|Execute Wing|48|2 * Wing Playbacks|None|4
|=======================


Note that the Mini Wing, PC Wing and Maxi Wing can be connected to a
MagicQ console to enable extra DMX outputs from the console. Note that
they duplicate the Main Playbacks (1-10) – they do not enable extra
Playbacks.


==== Connecting a Mini Wing, PC Wing or Maxi Wing

Before you can use the MagicQ PC Wing the <<_installing_software,driver>> must be
installed.

To enable the wing ensure that Setup, View Settings, Ports, MagicQ Wings & Interfaces is set to "Yes (auto DMX)".

The following short-cuts make programming on MagicQ PC Wing easier. The
short cuts also work on MagicQ console.


.Programing Wing Shortcuts
|=======================
|Hold ALL and press a playback Select|Selects groups 1 to 10
|Hold POS and press a playback Select|Selects position palette entry
|Hold COL and press a playback Select|Selects colour palette entry
|Hold BEAM and press a playback Select|Selects beam page or beam palette entry
|Hold ALL and press Next Head|Selects next group
|Hold ALL and press Prev Head|Selects previous group
|Hold POS, COL, or BEAM and press Next Head|Selects next range for last encoder changed
|Hold POS, COL or BEAM and press Prev Head|Selects previous range for last encoder changed
|=======================

To connect a Mini, PC or Maxi Wing to a console simply enable the MagicQ
Wings and Interfaces option.


==== Connecting Playback Wings and Extra Wings

To configure Playback Wings and Extra Wings open the Setup Window and
choose View System, View Wings view.

In the Type field, choose "Playback / Extra Wing". When the console has
detected the Playback wing it will show as "Fitted" in the status field.
If you wish to connect more than one Playback or Extra Wing then enable
the required number of Wings.

Make sure you enable enough the same number of wings as you connect to
MagicQ. Connecting more Wings to MagicQ than you enable will cause
unpredictable results.



==== Connecting an Execute Wing

The Execute Wing has 48 playbacks arranged as 12 fader playbacks and 36
button only playbacks. The Execute Wing can be configured simply to
control Playbacks, or it can be set in a mode whereby the 36 button only
playbacks become a 72 button matrix for use selecting heads, palettes,
groups, media and execute buttons.

To configure the MagicQ Execute Wing it must be set up as two
consecutive wings in Setup, View System, View Wings. The first wing
must be configured as “Execute” and the second wing as “Execute Top”.
This corresponds to the 48 playbacks whereas with standard Playback
Wings there are only 24 playbacks.

The Execute Wing has a mode button called MENU. When this is pressed and
held then the 2^nd^ row of buttons becomes a mode selection page. The
mode button affects the top 3 rows of playbacks – it does not affect the
bottom row of 12 playbacks – they are always configured as normal
Playbacks.

The mode options are:

|===
|Playbacks|3 rows of 12 playbacks each with separate GO/PAUSE (default)
|Exec|Access to the Execute Window, enabling complete user configuration
of the buttons. Use PG UP and PG DN to select the Exec Page.
|Heads|Selecting heads. Use PG UP / PG DN to scroll pages of heads.
|Palet|The buttons are automatically split into 24 Groups, 16 position
palettes, 16 colour palettes and 16 beam palettes.
|Media|Access to the Media Window. Shows media page options, servers,
layers and images as in the Media Window. Use the 2^nd^ down PG UP/PG DN
buttons to change the Media Bank. Use the 3^rd^ down PG UP/PG DN buttons
to change the Media Image.
|Cues|Testing of Cues. Use PG UP / PG DN to scroll pages of cues.
|Cue Stack|Testing of Cue Stacks. Use PG UP / PG DN to scroll pages of
Cue Stacks.
|DMX Test|Tests individual DMX channels. Use PG UP / PG DN to scroll
pages of channels.
|Head Test|Tests (locates) individual heads. Use PG UP / PG DN to scroll
pages of heads.
|===

When selecting the mode, you can choose to press the SELECT button or
the FLASH button associated with the mode. In some of the modes this
will alter the behaviour. For example, in the Heads Test, DMX Test, Cues
and Cues Stack modes, this determines whether the test is latching or
momentary.

In Playback mode the upper 3 rows of playbacks control playbacks in the
usual way. Note that as they do not have a fader, the value the
attributes that would normally be controlled by the fader (generally
Intensity values) will automatically default to 100%. The Playbacks can
still have times in the normal way, so that Intensity values can be
faded in and out.**

==== Using a MQ60/MQ70 as a network wing

MagicQ MQ60 and MQ70 consoles can now be used as network wings when connected to a PC or Mac running MagicQ thus enabling a full 64 universe show to be run from the PC/Mac but with physical control from the MQ60/70.  This overcomes the 12 universe limit on the MQ60/70.

Net wing mode is activated by connecting the MQ60/70 to the PC/Mac via network and then on the MQ60/70 going to Setup, View System, View Monitors and pressing SHIFT and Remote Net Wing.  The MQ60/70 will give a list of possible MagicQ systems to connect to.  This is similar to remote control, except that the DMX ports on the MQ60/70 automatically are set to output the first four universes from the PC/Mac.

It is possible to configure the MQ60/70 to always start up in Net Wing mode - set Setup, View Settings, Window, Start Mode to Net Wing.

When in Net Wing mode the status bar shows NETW.

Press CTRL CLOSE to exit Net Wing Mode.

==== Connecting MagicQ consoles together

It is possible to connect multiple MagicQ consoles together in order to
control a larger number of Universes. The master MagicQ console then
outputs some channels which act like playbacks for the slave consoles.

On the slave consoles, one of the wings is configured as "DMX In" and
select a range of channels for it to respond to. Note that the universe
that contains these channels must have input enabled in the "View DMX
I/O" view. This causes the playbacks on the wing to be controlled by up
to 24 DMX channels received into the console. The level of the playback
is determined from the received channel.


==== Using an external DMX console for extra playbacks

It is possible to use an external DMX console to gain extra playback
controls when using MagicQ consoles. This is not a replacement for a
MagicQ Playback wing with its electronic legending and Cue Stack
controls.

On MagicQ PC this option is only available to control Playbacks PB1 to
PB10 and is only enabled when a MagicQ Wing or MagicQ USB Interface is
connected. This feature allows synchronisation of MagicQ with other
consoles.

Configure an unused wing to be "DMX In" and select a range of channels
for it to respond to. Note that the universe that contains these
channels must have input enabled in the "View DMX I/O" view.

In order to allow use of FLASH buttons on the external DMX console,
MagicQ uses the top 5% of the channel range as an indication that a
FLASH button has been pressed. On the external console the playback
master fader should be configured at a maximum of 95% with the flash
master set to 100%. If it is not possible to set the master levels
independently on the external DMX console then set the grand maser on it
to 95%.

=== Monitor Settings

==== Pro 2010 and Pro 2014 Operating System

On MagicQ consoles running the Pro 2010 operating system there is
support for 2 external monitors with resolution up to 1440x900. On
MagicQ consoles running the Pro 2014 operating system there is support
for 2 external monitors with resolution up to 1920x1080. These monitors
can be touch screens.

In Setup, View System, View Monitors set the required resolution in the
Resolution column and enable it. Monitor 3 and Monitor 4 are not used.

When using USB touch screens, go to Setup, View System, View Status,
Touchscreens to determine which touch screen is Touch 1 and which is
Touch 2.

Choose the touch type as appropriate - generally Normal or Egalix. Use
Board Test Mode (SHIFT + SHIFT) to prove that touch information is being
received correctly by MagicQ.


==== Pro (pre Pro 2010) Operating System

On the Pro Operating System Monitor output 1 is a duplicate of the on
board screen. This enables the console to continue to be used should
there be a problem with the on board screen. Monitor output 1 always
duplicates the on-board screen.

From software version 1.5.9.4 there is no longer support for output 2 on
Pro consoles since the graphics card is not capable of supporting
resolutions for modern monitors. Full external monitor support is
available through upgrade to Pro 2014.


==== Monitor settings on MagicQ PC / Mac

When using multiple monitors on a PC first enable the monitors in
Windows by putting the Windows desktop onto all the monitors. Then start
MagicQ PC and in Setup, View System, View Monitors enable the required
monitors.

The first monitor is the main MagicQ Window and must always be enabled. Enable all the monitors
that you wish to use for Multi Windows.

From the Toolbar select View, External or press the EXT button to move a Window between the different monitors.

Sizing of Windows on the other monitors occurs just like in the Main
Window – you can select full windows, half windows and quarter windows.
The entire space on the other monitors is used for MagicQ Windows. When
a Window is moved to another monitor the size is kept the same – for
example, if it was a quarter window on the Main MagicQ Window it will be
a quarter window on the other Window. 

You can change the size on the other windows, just like on the Main MagicQ Window from the View menu on the Toolbar or by using the SIZE
button.


==== Moving Windows to the External Monitor

Press EXT to move a Window to the External Monitor. The window that is
currently in focus is transferred to the external monitor. Press EXT to
return the window to the main monitor.

MagicQ includes an option to force a single window to the external
monitor output. The Window will remain on the external monitor except
when a SHIFT CLOSE is performed. This option is set in the Setup Window,
View Settings, Windows, Force Window on External Monitor 2.


==== Additional Cue Stack, Output and Programmer Windows

MagicQ supports three additional windows, the Cue Stack Info, Outputs
Info and Programmer Info windows. These windows are very similar to the
Cue Stack, Outputs and Programmer windows but are designed to allow
additional information to be shown.

For instance by using both the Outputs and the Outputs Info windows you
can view both the plan view and the data values simultaneously.

Similarly, the Cue Stack Info window is designed as a master window to
keep track of the Cue Stack on the currently selected playback. The
columns have been rearranged so that the comment field is shown as one
of the first columns. This is ideal for theatre playback where the
operator wishes to see notes about the Cues during playback – you could
for instance put a comment on a Cue “Call spots when actor enters stage
right”.

These windows can be accessed from the Console using the CTRL key. Press
CTRL and OUT for the Outputs Info window, CTRL and CUE STACKS for the
Cue Stack Info window, and CTRL and Prog for the Programmer Info Window.


==== Additional external screens (MultiWindows) on consoles

The MagicQ Pro 2010 and Pro 2014 support 2 external monitors directly
from the rear panel.

It is possible to connect more monitors (up to a total of 4) using the
MagicQ Multi Window application running on a PC. The MagicQ MultiWindow
application comes as part of the MagicQ PC installation. This can be
used to display windows from remote MagicQ systems. These additional
monitors can be touch screens if the PC supports them.

In order to enable Multi Windows connection on the MagicQ set the "Multi
Windows" option in the Setup Window, View Settings, Network to “Remote
MultiWindow”.

MagicQ MultiWindows itself has two modes of operation – automatic window
sizing and user window sizing.

Automatic window sizing divides each of the selected screens into
quarters just like the touch-screen on MagicQ. Windows can be moved from
the console to the PC using the EXT button (or SHIFT + SIZE). The SIZE
button enables the window to be sized on the PC just as it would on the
console.

User sizing forces MultiWindows to ignore the size of the window on the
console, and use a size specified by the user on the PC by dragging the
window to the required size.

In order to enable the Multi Windows application to connect to the
MagicQ application, set the "Multi Windows" option in the Setup window
on the console to “Remote MultiWindow”.


=== Touch Screen Settings

On PC / Mac systems touch monitors are set up under the operating system not under MagicQ.

MagicQ consoles support many different touch protocols - however we are reliant on the drivers available in Linux, so not all touch screens will be supported.  We strongly recommend you check the protocol is supported and test a sample with a MagicQ console before purchasing a touch screen.  We can not guarantee that any touch screen will work with MagicQ - the list below is for guidance only. 

We generally recommend Protouch and ELO AccuTouch and ELO IntelliTouch touch screens.  Note that ELO Acoustic Pulse Recognition (APR) touch screens are NOT supported.

==== Serial protocols

MagicQ Compact, Expert, Pro, and Pro 2014 consoles support the following serial protocols

* Ideal
* ProTouch
* A1
* ELO

==== USB protocols

MagicQ Pro 2010 and 2014 consoles have support for the following USB communication protocols 

* Elo 15  * 'E271-2210' 10-byte protocol 
* Elo legacy 'E281A-4002' 6-byte protocol
* Elo 16  * legacy 'E271-140' 4-byte protocol
* Elo legacy 'E261-280' 3-byte protocol
* eGalax Touchkit
* eTurboTouch CT-410/510/700
* 3M/Microtouch  EX II series
* ITM
* PanJit TouchSet
* eTurboTouch
* Gunze AHL61
* DMC TSC-10/25
* IRTOUCHSYSTEMS/UNITOP
* IdealTEK URTC1000
* General Touch
* GoTop Super_Q2/GogoPen/PenPower tablets
* JASTEC USB touch controller/DigiTech DTR-02U
* Zytronic capacitive touchscreen
* NEXIO/iNexio

MagicQ will show any detected touch screens in Setup, View System, View Monitors.

==== Configuring an external Touch Screen

To configure an external serial touch screen:

* In Setup, Vew Settings, Ports set Serial Remote Protocol to one of Ideal Touch, Pro Touch, A1 Touch, Elo Touch.
* In Setup, Vew Settings, Ports set Serial baud rate, parity, data bits, stops buts.  If in doubt set baud rate to 9600, data to 8 bits, stop bits to 1 and no parity.
* Select the Serial Touch Monitor to the monitor the serial touch is associated with.
* Press SHIFT + SHIFT to enter board test mode.  Moving a finger around the edge of the screen should report incrasing/decreasing X,Y values in the Status Window.
* Exit board test mode (SHIFT + SHIFT).
* Go to Setup, View Settings and select Calibrate Touch.  Press 1 to confirm.
* Now press the X on the external touch screen in the four different positions as requested.  Do not press on any other monitors except the one being calibrated.

To configure an external USB touch screen:

* Set up the Touch Type in Setup, View Settings, Monitors.  Start with Normal or eGalax.
* If a touch screen is detected then it will show up in the Touch Status field.
* Press SHIFT + SHIFT to enter board test mode.  Moving a finger around the edge of the screen should report incrasing/decreasing X,Y values in the Status Window.
* Exit board test mode (SHIFT + SHIFT).
* Go to Setup, View Settings and select Calibrate Touch.  Press 1 to confirm.
* Now press the X on the external touch screen in the four different positions as requested.  Do not press on any other monitors except the one being calibrated.

If the Touch Screen shows a status but does not give consistent values in Board Test then try a different Touch Type.
 
If the Touch Screen shows consistent values in Board Test but does not respond correctly then recalibrate the touch screen.


=== Mode & Security Settings

The Settings View of the Setup Window uses tabs to group similar settings
together.

image:images/setupmode.png[image]

==== Country

The country setting determines the Country. Currently the country
setting has the options UK, US, F (French), D (German), E (Spanish), P
(Portugese), I (Italian), NL (Dutch). The country setting changes the
menu items into the appropriate language. MagicQ restricts some options
including multi console programming on the US version.


==== Time Zone

This is used for astronomical scheduled events. Enter the time zone from
-23 to +23.


==== Latitude

This is used for astronomical scheduled events. Enter the latitude in
degrees.


==== Longitude

This is used for astronomical scheduled events. Enter the longitude in
degrees.

====  Programming

This setting allows recording of show data to be disabled. This prevents
show data from being recorded, moved, copied or updated. Use this option
to prevent show data being changed.

When this setting is set to disabled, recording is disabled.  Parameters of Cue Stacks
and Cues such as Chase Speed, Shape Size and times may still be
modified. To prevent all modification set Modifications to Disabled.

Programming defaults to enabled.

==== Modifications

This setting prevents Cue Stack and Cue data from being modified. Use
this setting to ensure that programmed Cues and Cue Stacks are played
back exactly as they were programmed.

Modifications defaults to enabled.


==== Test Mode

This setting allows Test mode to be disabled.  This prevents the user from testing Cues, Cue Stack, Playbacks
and Patched Heads from the respective Windows. Use this setting to avoid
accidental operation of these features.

Test Mode defaults to enabled.

==== Macros

This setting allows Macros to be disabled. This is useful in cases where
macros have been erroneously assigned to keys.

Macros defaults to enabled.

==== Visualiser

This option enables MagicQ to auto insert heads into the Visualiser when
they are patched. When the first head in a show is patched MagicQ
prompts the user whether they wish to insert into the Visualiser and
sets this option accordingly.


==== Auto Backup

This setting enables automatic back ups. It can be set to No, Yes, and
On Changes. By default it is set to On Changes.

For playback of shows you may wish to turn back ups off, especially if
you have a very large show as the back-up process may occasionally
affect the response of the console. We recommend you keep them on (On
Changes) for programming.


==== Keep a backup archive

With this setting enabled the MagicQ console keeps an
<<_backup_archive,archive>> of back-ups. It will only archive back-ups
created using Auto Backup above – therefore if you turn auto backup off
then you will not have an archive.


==== Show file path

The path where all show files will be stored. This path defaults to
“show”. It is possible to change this path, for example in an education
environment where it is necessary to have different accounts for
different users.

We recommend keeping this path set to "show" whenever possible.

==== Show file format

This provides an option for saving shows using higher resolution timing - this is for testing purposes only.


=== Programming Settings

Programming settings are automatically changed when you select the mode
– Normal, Theatre non-tracking, Theatre Tracking or Hog II Warp.

==== Activate Chans / Heads

This setting determines how channels are activated in the Programmer. If
set to Chans then when an attribute of a head is modified only that
channel is affected. If set to Heads then when an attribute of a head is
modified all the channels of that head are activated in the programmer.
The channels are activated using the value that they were at before they
were last cleared from the programmer.

Selecting Activate Heads ensures that all the channels of a head are
always present when recording a Cue. Note that if you plan to over-ride
attributes of head during playback then you are likely to require
Activate Chans – otherwise all attributes of the head will be
overridden.

MagicQ also supports “IPCB”, “IPC” and “Col”. These group similar
parameters together, so for example if you touch a colour attribute or
the colour attributes are loaded into the programmer. “IPCB” means all
Intensity, Position, Colour and Beam attributes work in this way,
whereas “IPC” only works on Intensity, Position and Colour attributes ,
not Beam attributes.



==== Programmer Tracking

This setting turns programmer <<tracking,tracking>> on and off. This
affects new Cues that are recorded to Cue Stacks. It does not modify
Cues or Cue Stacks that have been previously recorded.

Users should be aware that playback of Cue Stacks also depends on the
Track settings on each Cue in the Cue Stack – there are the three
options Track HTP, Track FX and Track LTP.

These options correspond to the the three options named Zero old HTP,
Zero old FX, Rel unused chans which are the inverse of the above
options.

The defaults for these options can be changed in the Cue Stack, View
Defaults, Step window.


==== Unused Chans return to defaults

This setting determines what happens to LTP channels that are not
controlled by any playbacks or the programmer. When enabled, channels
default to the Default values specified in the personality. When
disabled, channels hold their last value.


==== Programmer overrides HTP

This setting determines whether the programmer overrides HTP values on
playbacks. When set to Yes, any HTP channels in the programmer are no
longer affected by the levels of those channels on playbacks.

When set to No, the highest value of the channel from the Playbacks and
the Programmer is output.


==== Programmer overrides FX

This setting determines whether the programmer overrides FX on active
playbacks. When set to Yes, any channels that have base levels in the
programmer ignore FX for those channels from any active playbacks. Cues
are automatically recorded with the Cue Option, “Block FX” – this
ensures that when the Cues are played back other FX from other Playbacks
are blocked.

When set to No, FX active on playbacks add to the base levels in the
Programmer.


==== Highlight mode

This setting determines the <<highlightmode,highlight mode>>. The
options are "Normal”, “Advanced (highlights/lowlight)”, “Advanced
Highlight only” and “Advanced, no reset”.

In “Normal” mode, the intensities of the selected heads are reduced
except for the one (or ones in Odd/Even mode) that are being controlled.
Highlighting of the controlled head(s) makes programming of positions
much easier.

In "Advanced (highlight/lowlight)” mode, all the attributes of the heads
that are being controlled are set to the highlight values from the
Personality. If Single mode or Odd/Even mode is in operation then only
the subset of the selected heads is highlighted – the rest are
lowlighted.

“Advanced Highlight Only” is the same as above, but no lowlighting
occurs.

“Advanced no reset” is the same as “Advanced (highlight/lowlight)” but
is not cleared when you press CLEAR. Press Highlight again to reset it.


==== Fan Mode

This setting determines the <<fanmode,fan mode>>. The options are
“Normal” or “No Toggle”. When set to “Normal” fan mode can be entered
and exited by pressing the FAN button. With “No toggle” fan mode is only
entered when the FAN button is held down.


==== Select Multiple Groups

This setting enables multiple to be selected without pressing SHIFT. To
deselect all groups press the DESELECT ALL soft button in the Group
Window.

The options are “No”, “Multiple in one Go” and “Multiple always”.

Whens set to “No” only one Group can be selected at one time – selecting
a second group releases the first group. Pressing SHIFT and multiple
groups allows multiple groups to be selected.

“Multiple in one Go” allows multiple groups to be selected until a head
attribute is changed – then it starts with a new selection of groups.


==== Recording to Palettes

The options are “Only selected heads” and “All heads in Programmer”. By
default only the selected heads are stored into Palettes when a Palette
is recorded.


==== Record merge overrides times

By default when the Programmer is merged into a Cue using Record Merge,
the times in the Cue are overwritten with the times in the Programmer.
This setting enables this to be changed so that the times in the Cure
are not overwritten.


==== Update Clears Programmer

By default the Programmer is not cleared when the Update button is
pressed.


=== Keypad / Encoder Settings

==== Auto enter on keypad intensity set

This setting determines whether when entering keypad intensity settings
an ENTER is required. If set then an auto enter is processed when 2
digits have been keyed in after @ or immediately after FULL.

1 THRU 4 @ 50

or

1 THRU 4 @ FULL


==== Select heads on keypad intensity set

This setting determines whether the current head selection is modified
when you set intensities using the keypad. When set to "No" the intensities are set without modifying the head selection. When set "yes" the intensities are set and then the head selection is modified,
for example:

1 THRU 4 @ 50 ENTER

sets heads 1 to 4 at 50% intensity and selects heads 1 to 4.

+5 @ FULL

sets head 5 to 100% intensity and adds head 5 to the current selection


==== Select Heads and Palettes from keypad

This setting was renamed from “Select Heads in Col, Beam, Pos”

This setting enables you to select Heads and Palettes from the keypad
and various other advanced keypad functions. Select heads by typing the
head selection and then pressing the appropriate Colour, Beam or
Position Window button.

1 THRU 4 COL

selects heads 1 through 4 and opens the Colour Window.

1 THRU 4 COL 5

selects heads 1 through 4 and selects Colour Palette 5.

It also enables selecting on Color, Beam and Position palettes direct
from the keypad.


==== Select heads on include

This setting determines whether when you include Cues and Palette
entries into the programmer the console automatically selects the heads.

If set to Yes, the console selects all heads that have levels in the Cue
or Palette entry.


==== Keypad always selects heads

When this setting is set to Yes, entering head numbers on the keypad
followed by the ENTER key always selects the heads. When set to Yes,
some of the advanced features of MagicQ are not available directly from
the keypad. When editing numeric fields in the spreadsheet style windows
in this mode, the operator must use the SET button rather than editing
the field directly.

This setting has a “Strict” option. In this mode it is not possible to
toggle or choose items simply using the ENTER key. You must use SET
first. This should help keypad fanatics to avoid setting options in
Windows accidentally.


==== Keypad Syntax (Theatre Patch)

This setting swaps around the syntax used for patching Heads. The normal
syntax for patching (Theatre Path is se to No) is

<number of heads> @ <dmx address>


When set to Yes, the syntax for patching is:

<head number> @ <dmx address>

Thatre Patch supports patching multiple multiple DMX addresses to one
head when using Theatre Patch syntax. For example to patch Head no 10 at
DMX addresses 1, 2 and 3 enter

10 @ 1 + 2 + 3

As with the Patch, View DMX there is a maximum of 6 DMX addresses per
Head.

In Theatre Patch it is possible to repatch dimmer channels. If the head
is already unpatched then just enter the new address – e.g. to repatch
head number 20 to DMX channel 25.

20 @ 25

It is possible to repatch to multiple DMX addreses – e.g. to repatch
head number 20 to DMX channel 25 and 26.

20 @ 25 + 26

If the head number is already patched then MagicQ will request
confirmation whether to Repatch the exiting Head with the specified Head
No or to patch another Head with the same number.


==== Encoder Mode

By default MagicQ sets the encoder wheels according to the currently
active Window – so for example when you change to Colour Window, the
encoder wheels control colour and when you change to Group, the encoder
wheels control Group settings.

When encoder mode is set to Maintain Pos, Col, Beam, the Position,
Colour and Beam buttons will act like “Hard Buttons” – so that the
encoders will be maintained on Position, Colour or Beam even when the
Group or Output Windows are opened. At any time the encoders can be
forced to their default settings for the Window by using SHIFT and the
Window button – e.g. SHIFT + GROUP.

In addition the “Intensity” attribute will also appear on Encoder F in
the Pos window if that encoder is not already used for position
attributes.

When encoder mode is set to Intensity on X, then when setting an
intensity level from the keypad, MagicQ will open the Intensity Window
and the X encoder will control intensity.

When encoder mode is set to “Pos, Col, Beam, Int X” then MagicQ performs
both the above options.


==== Swap pan and tilt encoders

This setting swaps over the pan and tilt encoders. By default the left
encoder is pan and the right encoder is tilt.


==== Swap Encoder direction

The following options are supported:

* Normal
* Swap all encoders
* Swap both pan and tilt encoders
* Swap pan encoder only


==== Swap Palette and Cursor Page Buttons

Enables the Cursor Page buttons (Page Left, Home, Page Up, Page Right,
End, Page Down) to be used as Palette buttons (Group, Int, Fx, Pos, Col,
Beam). This makes it easier to select Palettes using the keypad.

When this mode is enabled the Palette Buttons become the Cursor Page
buttons.

It is strongly recommended that you do not change the physical key caps
of these buttons since this may cause irreparable damage to the front
panel board.


==== MagicQ keyboard mode

This mode sets the function of the keyboard.

Note that in playback shortcuts mode many programming options will not
work as expected because the keyboard keys are used for busking.


==== Map Keys to THRU, @, FULL

This setting allows the THRU, @ and FULL keys to be mapped to different
keys on the keyboard. This is useful in some countries where the normal
mappings (>, @ and #) are not easy to select. To set this setting,
simply press the 3 keys you wish for the functions followed by ENTER.


==== Enable Mouse to control pan/tilt

This setting enables a mouse or track ball to control pan and tilt. See
<<_using_a_mouse_or_track-ball_to_control_pan_and_tilt,mouse controls pan/tilt>>.

The sensitivity can be selected by choosing the Enabled Div 2 through
Enabled Div 9 options.

Mouse control of pan/tilt is only supported on MagicQ consoles, and on
MagicQ PC systems with a MagicQ PC Wing or MaxiWing connected.


=== Windows Settings

==== Colour Scheme

There are options for the default colour scheme (Grey), high contrast or Grey (black text) colour
scheme. The Grey (black text) is useful on some TFT/LCD screens.


==== Big Text Mode

This setting shows all text in CAPITALS regardless of how it is
programmed in the show. There is also an option to capitalise only the
first letter of names.


==== Icon Size

This setting sets the size of icons – small take up only a
part of Window items – large takes up the whole item.

==== Speed Display

Choose how speed is displayed for chases and FX - seconds, BPM, or
frames.


==== Attribute Display

This determines how attributes values are displayed for Encoders –
normal, 16bit, %, or pan and tilt in %.


==== Column Hiding

When set to Yes, MagicQ hides columns that are unused – e.g. attributes
that the patched moving lights do not support. When set to No all
columns are shown regardless of whether they are used.


==== Auto Row Ordering

When set to Yes, MagicQ automatically orders the rows in the Outputs
Windows, Programmer Windows and Cue Windows. The currently selected
heads appear at the top of the window.

When set to No, the rows are ordered according to the Sort option
specified in the Patch Window.


==== Confirmation requests

This setting sets the default for confirm boxes. It can be set to
“Confirm (default no)”, “Confirm (default yes)” and “no confirm”. The
“Confirm (default no)” is the default option. Use the “no confirm
option” with great care!


==== Scroll bars

This setting allows a choice of scroll bars, from none, normal and wide.


==== Layout buttons always active

This setting splits the function of the top soft buttons above the
screen. The physical buttons are changed so that they always select
layouts. The menu buttons associated with each window are then available
using the touch screen. This option is useful on larger shows when you
need to often switch between layout views.


==== Start mode

This option selects how MagicQ starts – whether it shows a splash
screen, whether it prompts to open demo shows, or whether it opens the
Visualiser.


==== Always show Record Options

When this setting is set to Yes, MagicQ always shows a Record Options
toolbar when the Record button is pressed. An Include Options toolbar is
shown when Include is pressed.


==== Force Window on External Monitor

This setting determines how windows are shown on the External Monitor.

It is possible to force a particular Window to be displayed on the
External Monitor regardless of other Windows moved onto the Monitor.
Options are “None”, “Outputs Info”, “Programmer Info”, “Cue Stack
Info”,”Group” and “Exec”.

There are also options to set the sizing (number of columns) on the
external monitors to be the same as on the internal touch screen. You
can choose the additional options “Normal same res” and “Normal 10
cols”. “Normal same res” makes the external monitor use the same number
of rows and columns as when the window is on the internal monitor.
“Normal 10 cols”. Makes the external monitor always use 10 columns
regardless of what size the window is.


==== Plan Intensity type

Setting for how the Plan View in the Outputs Window shows intensities –
either using glass fill or colour grading.



==== Message Window

This specifies where the message box is shown (main screen, external
screen 1, external screen 2) and whether a network message is sent to
other consoles.

Setting “Net Only” results in messages only being sent over the network,
not shown on the console where the Cue executed.



=== Cue Storage Settings

==== Delete Cues when delete Cue Stacks

With this setting you can force Cues to be deleted when the Cue Stack
that uses them is deleted. Cues are only deleted if they are not used in
other Cue Stacks. This option defaults to No.


==== Delete Cue Stacks on remove Playbacks

With this setting you can force Cue Stacks to be deleted when the
Playback is deleted. Cue Stacks are only deleted if they are not used in
other Playbacks. This option defaults to No.


==== Use first free Cues, Stacks, Palettes

By default MagicQ uses the lowest free Cue when recording new Cues. It
also uses the lowest free Cue Stack when recording new Cue Stacks and
lowest free Palette when automatically recording Palettes.

Setting this setting to No, forces MagicQ to record items after the
place the last items were recorded – enabling the user to control where
new items are recorded.


==== Copy mode (linked/unlinked)

By default when you copy a Cue Stack, MagicQ creates a new Cue Stack but
retains links to the old Cues – i.e. no new Cues are made. Using SHIFTCOPY you can specify an unlinked copy whereby new Cues are made.

This setting allows the default Copy behaviour to be changed so that the
copy is always unlinked unless SHIFT + COPY is pressed.

The options are “linked”, “unlinked” and “unlinked, no state”.

The “unlinked, no state” option specifies that when Cues are copied
within a Cue Stack only the “delta” values are copied not the state of
the Cue at that step.


==== Derive settings from previous Cue

This setting specifies how MagicQ sets the Cue settings for new Cues
recorded on a Cue Stack.

When this setting is set to No, MagicQ uses the default Cue settings
specified in the Step and Step Times tabs in the Cue Stack, View
Defaults view.

When this setting is set to Yes, MagicQ attempts to derive the setting
Cue settings from the previous Cue in the Cue Stack. If the Cue is the
first in the Cue Stack then MagicQ uses the default Step and Step Times.


==== Hide Cue Store Ids (Qids)

MagicQ supports two different ids for Cues – the Cue Id of the Cue
within the specific Cue Stack and the QId of the Cue within the Cue
Store.

Many users record Cues directly to Cue Stacks on Playbacks and do not
need to use the Cue Store. These users are only concerned with the Cue
Id in the Cue Stack.

When this setting is set to Yes, MagicQ hides the QId from the Cue Store
from the Cue Stack Windows and Cue Windows.



==== Expand palettes to same head type

This setting allows palettes to be automatically expanded to heads of
the same type. This enables palettes to be built up on a single head and
then expanded to all of the patched heads of that type.

It is possible to choose just Colours and Beams to be expanded or all
Palettes. Palettes are expanded when patching a new head and when
recording palettes.


==== Heads moved aside are unpatched

This setting determines that heads are unpatched rather than moved aside
when repatching and morphing.

When set to Yes, when repatching, any heads that need to be moved aside
to make room for new heads are unpatched.


=== Playback Settings

==== Grand Master function

The Grand Master can be configured to control only the level of preset
faders, as accessed through the <<_setting_intensity_levels,Intensities Window
Preset View>>. Alternatively, it may be configured to control only the
level of <<programmer,programmer>> data, or it may control both. In
each of these configurations it does not control
<<_playback,playbacks>> or <<_add_swap,add/swap>> levels.

When set as a Grand Master it controls Playbacks and the Programmer.


==== Sub Master function.

The Sub Master can be configured to control either
<<playback,playback>> faders only, or <<addswap,add/swap>> buttons
only, or both (the default).

It can also be set as a programmer master, a preset master or both.


==== Crossfade Master function

The Crossfade master can be configured in several different ways:

* Manual Crossfade (default)
* Rate Master
* Global Rate Master
* Busking Rate Master
* Cue Stack Rate Master
* Cue Stack Global Rate Master
* Sub Master

See <<_manual_control,manual control>>, <<_rate_sub_master,rate
master>> for more details.

Sub Master is useful on Compact Consoles which do not have a separate
sub master fader. When set to sub master, the Sub Master function above
determines its function.

==== Split Crossfade on PB9/PB10

When enabled from the Setup Window, playbacks faders 9 and 10 become
Cross Masters for manual Fade In and Fade Out. Pressing the Pause button
on either playback 9 or 10 brings the current playback under manual
control.

The two faders can then be used to fade in each new Cue with separate
control for fade in and fade out.

Pressing the Go button on either Playback 9 or 10 returns the current
playback to normal Cue execution.

When enabled, playbacks faders 9 and 10 can not be used as normal
playbacks.

==== Crossfade controls Playback

This setting enables the user to lock the manual playback section of
MagicQ to Playback Fader 1, 2, 9 or 10 regardless of the currently
selected Playback. This is designed for theatrical use where one
playback is the master Cue Stack. The default is “Selected Playback”.


==== Stomp Playbacks

When the <<_playback_stomping,Playback Stomping>> option is enabled, playbacks
that have been fully overridden by other playbacks will be automatically
released (stomped).


==== Intensity (HTP) FX can subtract

This option determines whether one Playback intensity level can subtract
from another Playback’s level. When set to “yes” an FX on one Playback
can subtract from the level on another Playback. When set to “no” MagicQ
performs pure HTP – i.e. the highest level (including FX) from all the
Playbacks is output.


==== Go reasserts channels

This setting determines which channels are reasserted when the Go button
of a Playback is pressed. The options are “All inc tracked”, “non
tracked” and “All no fade”.

When set to “All inc tracked”, then pressing GO on the Playback will
reassert channels that are tracking through the Cue Stack even if they
were being controlled by another Playback. When set to “non tracked”
only channels that are recorded as “hard values” in the current Cue will
be reasserted.

“All no fade” forces an immediate change of the channel values
controlled by the Playback.


==== Fader off zero reasserts channels

This setting is used to reassert channels using the fader. This setting
is useful when using Cue Stacks with the “Fader Releases” set to No and
“Flash releases” set to No.

When set to Yes, faders reassert the Playback when the level leaves
zero. The setting “Go reasserts channels” specifies how the channels are
reasserted.

==== Next Page changes to next used

This setting enables page changes using the Next Page and Prev Page
buttons to only access programmed pages rather than changing through all
pages. Any page can be accessed through the Page Window.


==== Current Playback follows last touched

This setting makes the Current Playback follow the last Playback fader
to be raised. If set to No then the Current Playback is not changed when
faders are raised - it is only changed when SELECT buttons are pressed.


==== Playbacks S + GO = PAUSE

This setting changes the function of S + GO on Playbacks. By
default S + GO steps to the next step without time. This option enables S + GO to be
changed to be a PAUSE function for either Wing Playbacks or all Playbacks. This is useful on Wing
Playbacks or on Mini Wings that do not have physical PAUSE buttons.


==== Tap to Time buttons

Enables the GO, PAUSE buttons or the S buttons to be permanently set to
Tap to Time. The options are

* GO buttons
* FLASH buttons
* S + GO buttons
* S + FLASH buttons
* S +  buttons


==== Activate playbacks on start

This option enables one or more playbacks to be activated on start up.  The options include:

* None
* PB1
* Last Active
* Wing 1 PB 1
* Cue Stack 1
* Macro 1
* Lamp On All

When set to “Activate Playback PB” then when MagicQ starts PB1 is
activated. This can then be used to activate other playbacks and
potentially run a complete show without user intervention.

When set to “Last active” then after a power up or a reset, MagicQ will
reactivate Cue Stacks that were running when the console was powered
down or reset. MagicQ will start the Cue Stacks from the step that they
were previously on.

Note that all the options except for the PB1 option are only available
on MagicQ consoles or on MagicQ PC systems with MagicQ Wings or
Interfaces attached.


==== Run in Execute Window

This setting starts the console / MagicQ PC up in the
<<_execute_window,Execute Window>>.


=== Network Settings

==== IP Address

The console stores the TCP/IP address and subnet mask for the network
interface. The addresses are stored as part of the console configuration
rather than as part of the show data. Thus erasing show data does not
affect their configuration.

For communicating with Art-Net the TCP/IP address must be
set to a number in the range 2.x.x.x (e.g. 2.0.0.10) and the Sub net
address must be set to 255.0.0.0.

On MagicQ PC the TCP/IP address of the system must be configured through Windows, Control Panel.  On Mac it must be configured through System Preferences.  In addition the MagicQ software must also be told the TCP/IP address so that it knows which network interface to use.  In Setup, View Settings, Network set the IP address to be the same as the network port of the PC / Mac you wish to use.


====  Subnet Mask

The sub net mask for the network interface.

For communicating with an Art-Net convertor the the Sub net address must
be set to 255.0.0.0.

==== Send to applications on this PC

This setting is used to send Output data internally to other
applications on the same PC. This can be used to connect to a 3rd
party Visualiser or the MagicQ Media Centre on the same PC.

This setting is valid for PCs and Macs only – it is ignored on MagicQ
consoles.

==== Ethernet remote protocol

Enables transmission and reception of ChamSys Remote Protocol for
communication over Ethernet (UDP/IP) with external 3^rd^ party systems.
The options are:

* ChamSys Rem (rx)
* ChamSys Rem (tx & rx)
* ChamSys Rem (tx)

If set to None then any data received is ignored. When transmission is
enabled, data can be transmitted from the Macro field of Cue steps in
the Cue Stack.

When using network sessions or multi console operation this option
should be set to None.

See <<_chamsys_remote_ethernet_protocol,ChamSys Remote Ehthernet Protocol>> and
<<_networking_of_multiple_consoles,Multiple Consoles>> for more details.


==== Playback Sync Port

It is possible to configure the port used for synchronisation of
playback between multiple MagicQ consoles. The default port is 6553. If
this port interferes with other equipment for any reason then it is
possible to change it.

Note that this port is also used for Net Sessions - so it must be the same on all systems using Net Sessions.

==== Web Server

This is used to enable the in-built Web server which enables remote
access to the console functions from other equipment using web browsers.
The option “Enabled CSS” uses improved CSS style sheet web pages.

==== Web Server Port

The default web server port is 8080.


==== Gateway address

For future use.

==== Control net IP address

For future use.

==== Control net subnet mask

For future use.


==== Wireless Mode

Choice of wireless mode when using a USB to Wireless interface with the
MagicQ Pro 2010 or Pro 2014 console.  Also when using the internal wireless support on a MQ70.  The options are 

* Disabled
* Managed (2010/2014)
* Ad-Hoc (2010/2014)
* Access Point (MQ70)

When using an external wireless access point via fixed network this option should be set
to Disabled.


==== Wireless IP address

IP address when using a USB to Wireless interface with the MagicQ Pro
2010 or Pro 2014 console.  Also for MQ70.

For ad-hoc connection to an iPhone or iPod Touch use 192.168.1.20.


==== Wireless subnet mask

Sub net address when using a USB to Wireless interface with the MagicQ
Pro 2010 or Pro 2014 console.  Also for MQ70.

For ad-hoc connection to an iPhone or iPod Touch use 255.255.255.0.

MagicQ Pro 2010 or Pro 2014 console.  Also for MQ70.

For connection to an iPhone or iPod Touch try channel 5.


==== Wireless SSID

Wireless SSID (identifier of the Wireless network) to use when using a
USB to Wireless interface with the MagicQ Pro 2010 or Pro 2014 console.  Also for MQ70.

For connection to an iPhone or iPod Touch enter a name for your network
– e.g. mynetwork.


==== Wireless encryption

Wireless encryption type when using a USB to Wireless interface with the
MagicQ Pro 2010 or Pro 2014 console.  Also for MQ70.

The options are None, WEP, WPA or MQ.

WEP and WPA are secure wireless encryption methods. Set the key in the
Wireless Key field.

When set to MQ the wireless is kept open but the application requires
users to enter a password to connect to the console. The password should
be set in the Wireless Key field. When this option is selected the
iPhone remote will be passworded regardless of whether the connection is
made through a USB to Wireless interface or an access point external to
the MagicQ system.


==== Wireless key

Wireless encryption type when using a USB to Wireless interface with the
MagicQ Pro 2010 or Pro 2014 console. Used when Wireless encryption is
set to WEP or WPA.  Also for MQ70.

For WPA the key must be 8 or more characters.

When Wireless Encryption is set to MQ then the Wireless key is used to
specify to a password that must be entered on the iPhone Application.


=== Port Settings

==== MagicQ Wings and Interfaces

This setting enables MagicQ Wings and ChamSys USB interfaces to be
connected. The options are No, Yes, and Yes – auto DMX.

This option affects MagicQ Wings (Mini, PC, Maxi, Extra, Playback,
Execute) and USB Interfaces (Twin DMX, Audio, SMPTE).

On MagicQ consoles, when set to Yes – auto DMX then MagicQ automatically
outputs on the rear DMX ports starting from Universe 1 – provided that
none of the Universes have been explicitly set to “MQ Direct”.

On MagicQ PC/Mac when set to Yes – auto DMX then MagicQ automatically
outputs DMX from a connected MagicQ Wing starting from Universe 1 –
provided that none of the Universes have been explicitly set to “MQ
Wing”.

This option also enables MagicQ to search for SnakeSys products on the
network to unlock demo mode on PCs and Macs.


==== MagicDMX mode

The options are None, DMX Out or DMX In. This option defaults to DMX
Out.

Setting the Out Type of Universe 1 in Setup, DMX I/O to MagicDMX will
automatically set this option to DMX Out.

Note that DMX In is not available on the MagicDMX Basic version.


==== Serial COM port

MagicQ supports one serial port for remote connections. On MagicQ
consoles select COM1. On MagicQ PC select a COM port from COM1 to COM8
depending on which COM port you wish to use.


==== Serial baud rate

MagicQ consoles support baud rates from 300 to 57600. Baud rates
supported on MagicQ PC will depend on the PC.

==== Serial parity

MagicQ PC supports None, Odd, Even, Mark and Space. MagicQ consoles only
support None, Odd, Even.

==== Serial data bits

Data bit sizes of 4,5,6,7 and 8 are supported.


==== Serial stop bits

MagicQ PC Supports 1,1.5 or 2 stop bits. MagicQ consoles support 1 or 2
stop bits.


==== Serial remote protocol

Determines what protocol is used on the serial port. If set to “none”
then any data received is ignored. Data can be transmitted from the
Macro field of Cue steps in the Cue Stack.

The other protocols are:

* ChamSys Rem (rx)
* ChamSys Rem (tx & rx)
* ChamSys Rem (tx)
* Ideal Touch
* A1 Touch
* Elo Touch

The Touch protocols are for the use of external RS232 serial touch
screens with the MQ50, MQ100, MQ200 and MQ300 consoles. Refer to the
instruction manual of your touch screen for other serial settings.

See <<_controlling_magicq_using_serial_port,Controlling MagicQ Using Serial Port>> and
<<_multiple_consoles,Multiple Consoles>> for more details.


==== Serial touch monitor

Determines which monitor on the MagicQ system has a touch screen
connected to the serial port.

==== Remote trigger type

This setting specifies how the remote input port on MagicQ consoles,
MagicQ PC Wings and MagicQ Maxi Wings works.

It can be set to None, Make, Break, or Make + Break.


==== Remote trigger action

This setting specifies specific global actions to be taken on a remote
trigger input. The options are:

The options are:

* NONE
* CURRENT PLAYBACK GO
* CURRENT PLAYBACK FLASH
* ADD/SWAP
* SWAP
* DBO
* WING1 PB1 GO
* WING1 PB1 FLASH
* WING1 PB12 GO
* WING1 PB12 FLASH
* PB10 GO
* PB10 FLASH
* AUDIO BUMP

The remote trigger can be used on a per Cue Stack basis by setting the
Halt field of Cue step in the Cue Stack to “Remote”. This is independent
of any global action specified by the Remote trigger action setting.

Audio bump simulates audio received at full level.  It is processed by MagicQ just as if the "bump" had been received from the audio port or the MagicQ Audio Interface, bumping any Cue Stacks set to Audio Bump.


==== Audio input

The type of audio input – the options are None, “Energy only ChamSys
audio”, “ChamSys audio interface” and “ChamSys audio left only”,
"Console inbuilt port" and "PC/Mac sound card".

See <<_audio,Audio>> for full details on audio input.

==== Audio Min / Max Level

The levels of the audio input level. The minimum is used to adjust for
noise whilst the maximum can be set of the audio signal is particularly
weak.

When set to non zero values any levels below the minimum or above the
maximum are ignored and the levels are scaled appropriately.

See <<_audio,Audio>> for full details on audio input.


==== Parallel Port Address

For use with the Artistic License parallel port dongle.


==== Monitor Settings

The Monitor settings have been moved to Setup, View System, View
Monitors.


=== MIDI / Timecode Settings

==== Timecode frame type

The timecode type can be set to EBU-25, SMPTE30, NTSC30 and Film 24.
When a ChamSys MIDI/SMPTE module is fitted the Status Display will show
the current time-code being received from the module.


==== Timecode continue frames

When MagicQ is set to external timecode and the external timecode source
is termporarily lost MagicQ automatically continues to increment the
timecode. This parameter specifies how long MagicQ continues generating
for before it stops. After this time the time-code will be frozen until
a signal is received again.


==== Timecode jump detect frames

The timecode jump detect parameter is the number of frames that MagicQ
waits before performing a jump. This allows spurious timecode values to
be ignored.

The MIDI Show Control type specifies how MagicQ treats MIDI show control
commands,


==== Timecode in type

The options are None, LTC, MIDI, Art-Net and Winamp.

When this option is set, then timecode generation should be set to None.


==== Timecode generation

The options are None, LTC, MIDI and Art-Net (retransmit).

Art-Net (retransmit) causes any LTC or MIDI timecode received from the
ChamSys MIDI/SMPTE interface to be retransmitted on the network as
Art-Net timecode.

When this option is set to LTC or MIDI, then timecode in type should be
set to None.


==== MIDI In Type 

The options are None, Any Channel or Requested Channel. When set to Any
Channel MagicQ will process MIDI notes received on any MIDI channel.
When set to Requested Channel then MagicQ will only process MIDI notes
received on the MIDI In Channel that is set.

This option can be used at the same time as timecode in / timecode
generation.


==== MIDI In Channel

The MIDI Channel that MagicQ will listen to.  When set to 0 it accepts MIDI commands on any MIDI channel.


==== MIDI Out Type

The options are None, Any Channel or Requested Channel. When set to Any
Channel MagicQ will send MIDI notes on the channel specified in the
macro field in the Cue Stack. When set to Requested Channel then MagicQ
will always send the MIDI notes on the MIDI Out Channel that is set
regardless of the channel specified in the macro field in the Cue Stack.

This option can be used at the same time as timecode in / timecode
generation.

==== Midi Out Channel

The MIDI channel that MagicQ will send out on.  When set to 0 it outputs on the MIDI channel specified in the Cue Stack macro field.  When set to non zero it overrides the MIDI channel.


==== MIDI Show Control Type

The options are Normal, Cue Stack 1, Playback 1. This determines which
Cue Stack is triggered when MIDI Show Control (MSC) commands are
received.

In normal mode, MSC commands with two parameters (Q number, Q list) will
trigger Cue Stacks in the Cue Stack Store. MSC commands with one
parameter (Q number) will trigger Cues in the Cue Store.


=== Multiple Console Settings

==== Enable remote access

Enables other MagicQ consoles to access files on this MagicQ system –
for example when grabbing show files from other consoles or
synchronising show data.

This option should be enabled when using Network Sessions, Show Sync or
operating a MagicQ console with the stand alone MagicVis application.


==== Enable remote control

Enables other MagicQ consoles to remote control this console using the
MagicQ remote control feature, the iOS/Android application, or the
MagicWand.


==== Net Session Mode

Enables network sessions whereby multiple MagicQ consoles can be used on
a network together. The options are “None”, “Manual Takeover” and “Auto
Takeover”.

See <<_networking_of_magicq_systems,Multiple Consoles>> for full details on using
multiple MagicQ consoles in a network.


==== Net Session ID

For use in Network Sessions to specify which session MagicQ consoles
join. Note that in most situations all MagicQ consoles will be used in
the same session, so the Network Session ID can be set to 0 on all
MagicQ consoles.


==== Hot Takeover Mode

This option is now superceeded by the Network Session Mode. For manual
configuration of this option see
<<_manual_configuration_of_multi_console_operation,Manual Configuration of Multi
Console>>.


==== Hot Takeover Detect Time

When Network Session Mode is set to “Auto Takeover” this specifies how
long after a Slave detects that there is no Master on the network before
it takes over control as Master.


==== Hot Takeover Fade Type

When Network Session Mode is set to “Auto Takeover” this specifies when
a Slave becomes a Master whether the output state is held or whether an
automatic fade is carried out to the output of the new Master.


==== Hot Takeover Fade Time

When Network Session Mode is set to “Auto Takeover” and Hot Takeover
Fade Type is set to Automatic then this specifies how long it takes to
fade the output when a Slave becomes a Master

==== Playback Sync Type

This option is now superseded by the Network Session Mode. For manual
configuration of this option see
<<_manual_configuration_of_multi_console_operation,Manual Configuration of Multi
Console>>.


==== Playback Sync IP

This option is now superseded by the Network Session Mode. For manual
configuration of this option see
<<_manual_configuration_of_multi_console_operation,Manual Configuration of Multi
Console>>.

When set to 0 playback sync is accepted from any MagicQ console on the network.


==== Playback Sync Slave Mode

When Network Session Mode is set then this specifies whether the Slave
synchronises its playbacks to the Master. When set to “Inhibit PB Sync”
the Slave playbacks are not synchronised – this is useful for example
when programming a show using multiple consoles.

For show playback the Slave playbacks are normally synchronised to the
Master.


==== Show data Sync Type

This option is now superseded by the Network Session Mode. For manual
configuration of this option see
<<_manual_configuration_of_multi_console_operation,Manual Configuration of Multi
Console>>.


==== Show data Sync IP

This option is now superseded by the Network Session Mode. For manual
configuration of this option see
<<_manual_configuration_of_multi_console_operation,Manual Configuration of Multi
Console>>.


=== Hardware Settings

==== Level above 0 to activate LTP

In some circumstances Playbacks may get triggered erroneously even when
the fader has not been raised above 0. In these circumstances setting
this level to a level above 0 (e.g. 5) may remove the erroneous
triggers.


==== Hysteresis on fader / encoder moves

In some circumstances faders or encoders may become faulty and generate
excess noise – in these circumstances setting this level to a level
above 0 (e.g. 5) may remove the effect of the fault.


==== Encoder Damping

Use this option on a MagicQ PC Wing to improve the performance of the
encoder wheels. This option does not have any effect on MagicQ consoles.


==== Touch Screen

The touch screen can be disabled with this setting in case it has gone
faulty and is causing problems.

==== Encoders

The encoders can be disabled in case they have gone faulty and are
causing problems.


==== Faulty Faders Mask

The faders can be disabled in case they have gone faulty and are causing
problems. This setting should normally be set to 0.

The following values can be used:

* Set to 1 to disable the main faders.
* Set to 2 to disable Wing 1 lower faders.
* Set to 4 to disable Wing 1 upper faders.
* Set to 8 to disable Wing 2 lower faders.
* Set to 10 to disable Wing 2 upper faders.


==== Power Fail Detection

This setting disables power fail detection for the current seesion in
case the power fail detection circuitry has gone faulty and is
continually reporting power fail.

This setting is not stored over a reset / power on.


==== Screen Save

This setting disables screen save for the current session.

This setting is not stored over a reset / power on.


==== Reduced rate output

By default MagicQ sets the reduced rate Output to “Mixed + Changes
only”. This reduces the amount of network/usb traffic when DMX values
are not changing. It also interleaves the ArtNet frames so that ArtNet
devices with small buffers will still be able to decode the correct
ArtNet universes on heavily loaded networks.

Consoles and PC installations that have been programmed on older
versions of MagicQ software will automatically have this option turned
to “Mixed + Changes only” when the system is first started after the
upgrade. Users can change the setting back to the previous setting if
required. The previous setting “Normal” has been renamed “Continuous”.
We recommend using the “Mixed + Changes only” option as your normal
setting particularly when using wireless networking.

Data packets sent to WWIWYG and Capture are sent only when the data
changes – thus significantly reducing network traffic when data is not
changing. The “reduced rate DMX” options do not affect the WYSIWYG or
Capture data.

The DMX data sent to MagicQ Wings and Interfaces is only sent when the
data changes – this reduces USB data traffic. When the data is
constantly changing there will be no difference. The RX data LED on
MagicQ Wings & Interfaces shows the level of DMX traffic – when DMX data
is not changing this LED will flicker a few times a second instead of
being on constantly.

Some older DMX equipment is not able to work at full DMX speed. Use this
option to reduce the DMX refresh rate – note that this option reduces
the rate of data MagicQ sends over the network or via USB to the
interface. It may not affect the actual DMX rate as this may be under
control of the interface itself.

Some Ethernet Interfaces and network hubs are unable to handle high
levels of Ethernet traffic, for example all 64 MagicQ universes output
simultaneously. On these devices set this option to “Mixed + Changes” –
this sends the Ethernet data at the same rate, but in alternating order,
thus ensuring that the Ethernet Interface can pick up the data.

Note that MagicQ will always send data on ArtNet and Visualiser at least
once every second regardless of whether data has changed.


==== Movie Buffer frames (0=use default)

MagicQ uses buffering for Movie clips. By default (when this settting is
set to 0) MagicQ uses a buffer size of 128 frames. MagicQ will always
use a minimum of 128 frames regardless of this setting.

Note that on Pro 2010 and Pro 2014 consoles MagicQ uses a solid state
disc so on these systems changing this parameter should not make
significant difference.

==== Debug Mode (Must be 0)

For ChamSys internal debugging only.  Must be set to 0.


==== Standard Logging

This option allows logging to be disabled. This option should always be
enabled except when directed by ChamSys support.


==== Extended Logging

This option allows extended logging to be enabled. ChamSys support may
request that Extended Logging is enabled in order to try to solve
problems.

=== General Settings

==== Splash screen image

Users can now add their own splash screen by copying their splash image
named usersplash.bmp into the MagicQ folder. This will be used in favour
of the default splash.bmp.


=== Individual Playback Settings

Settings for individual Playbacks (Cue Stacks) are configured from the
View Options and View Defaults views in the Cue Stacks Window. See
<<_Playback,Playbacks>>.


=== Calibrating the touch screen

If the touch screen does not respond accurately to the position that you
are pressing on the screen then you may need to re-calibrate the touch
screen. Don't be afraid, this is a painless exercise!

In the Setup Window press the Cal Touch button - use the physical button
rather than the pressing the touch screen. This puts the screen into
calibration mode. To calibrate the touch screen simply press the screen
in the bottom left corner of the screen and then the top right corner of
the screen. Press the screen on the corners where the displayed graphics
starts/ends.

It does not matter which order you press the screen in. If you feel you
have pressed the wrong bit of the screen just press the screen again in
the correct position.

When you are satisfied you have pressed the correct position then press
Cal Touch button to leave the calibration mode. Make sure you use the
physical button rather than pressing the touch screen, as pressing the
touch screen messes up the calibration.

You should now find that the touch screen is more accurate. If you
continue to have problems then try pressing the screen with a small
blunt object, but don't use a sharp object as it may damage the touch
screen.

When calibrating external touch screens calibrate only 1 touch screen at
a time. Pressing in more than one screen will cause unpredictable
results.


=== Displays brightness and contrast

To modify the brightness of the main display, press CTRL and adjust the
bottom right encoder. To modify the brightness of the LCD displays on
the wing, press CTRL and adjust the next encoder up on the right. To
turn all the displays off press CTRL and the button associated with the
bottom right encoder.

To turn off the all the lights on the console (i.e. the displays, the
console lights and the LEDs) press CTRL and the "All Lights" off button.

To modify the contrast of Playback wings use the Wing Contrast encoder.
When multiple Playback wings are connected press CTRL and the Next Page
button of the Wing you wish to change the contrast on.

=== Console lamp brightness

To modify the brightness of the console lamps press CTRL and adjust the
top right encoder. To turn all console lamps on or off, press CTRL and
the button associated with the top right encoder.


=== Button LED brightness

To modify the brightness of the LEDs on the buttons, press CTRL and adjust the bottom
left encoder.

Note that the brightness of the LEDs can only be adjusted from full to
dim - they can not be turned off completely. This ensures that there is
always an indication that the console is powered.


=== Controlling console lamp from the programmed show

The console lamp brightness, display brightness and LED brightness can
now be controlled as a fixture within the programming of the show. Patch
one “Generic MQlamps” at any free address. The fixture can be unpatched
to ensure that it does not affect any real channel outputs. The fixture
has the following attributes:

* activate set to 255 to take control of the console brightness
* master master level for brightness
* white lamp brightness
* blue lamp brightness
* main display brightness of display – 0 is off
* wing display
* led brightness of the LEDs

Note that the screen saver will still blank the display.


=== Locking the console

The console supports a simple locking mode to avoid accidental button
presses affecting the output or programmed data. Press CTRL and the
button associated with the top left encoder to lock / unlock the
console. The console will not accept any button presses while it is
unlocked.

A more advanced password system will be included in future software
releases.


=== Button test mode

The console supports a button test mode for checking suspect buttons and
faders. To enter button test mode press the two SHIFT buttons either
side of the touch screen together (i.e. hold one down and press the
other).

In button test mode the buttons do not have their usual function -
instead when pressed a message will be displayed in the status display
indicating which button has been pressed. Faders and encoders also can
be tested in a similar way.

In button test mode the Window shows a map of all the buttons, encoders
and faders. When a button is pressed the map turns green to indicate
that the button has been pressed and released o.k. For encoders it turns
green when the encoder has been turned both ways. For faders it turns
green when the fader has been lowered to 0 and raised to full.

To test LEDs, enter button test mode and then press CTRL 1 and CTRL 2 to
test the different colour LEDs. Press CTRL 0 to go back to normal state
of the LEDs.

Button test mode is exited in the same way that it is entered.

On MagicQ PC to enter button test mode type “test” on the keyboard then
hold SHIFT and CONTROL. Hold SHIFT and press CONTROL to exit button test
mode.
