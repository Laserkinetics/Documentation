=== Audio Input

Audio input can be used in many ways on MagicQ - to bump a Cue Stack
from step to step, to set a Cue Stack tempo, to set the virtual level of
the playback fader and as part of the MagicQ Pixelmapper.

Audio bump functions can also triggered from the <<_remote_input_port,remote input port>>.

==== Audio input ports

Audio input can be achieved on both MagicQ consoles and MagicQ PC via
the ChamSys Audio Interface module which connects via USB and performs 7 band hardware analysis of dual audio channels.

Audio input is also supported directly on MQ40, MQ60, MQ70 and Pro 2014
consoles and Compact PC Wings via dedicated audio ports. In Setup, View
Settings, Ports set Audio Input to Console Inbuilt Port. MagicQ Pro 2014
consoles require the latest Pro 2014 kernel whilst MQ40,MQ60 and MQ70
require the latest firmware.

From v1.6.0.9 MagicQ PC / Mac supports audio input through the PC /
Mac sound card when the PC/Mac is connected to a MagicQ Wing or
Interface (not MagicDMX). In Setup, View Settings, Ports set Audio Input
to PC/Mac sound card.


==== Audio options

The audio signal is analysed into 7 different frequency bands –
consisting of 63Hz, 160Hz, 400Hz, 1KHz, 2.5KHz, 6.2KHz, 16KHz, 63KHz.
The levels for each channel can be used on MagicQ to set the level of
Playbacks, to step through cue stacks and to set the speed of chases.

When connected, a graphic equaliser display is shown in the Status
Display showing the current levels of the inputs. Audio trigger level
should be set to 0.

==== Global audio settings

In order to use audio input on MagicQ set the setting Setup, View Settings, Ports, Audio, Audio Input.  The options are 

* None
* Energy only ChamSys audio
* ChamSys audio interface
* ChamSys audio left only
* Console inbuilt port"
* PC/Mac sound card".

On MagicQ PC / Mac systems select "Pc/Mac sound card".  Audio input is only supported when the PC/Mac is connected to a MagicQ Wing orInterface (not MagicDMX). This function was added in v1.6.0.9 software.

On MQ40, MQ60, MQ70, Pro 2014 consoles and PC Wing Compacts the audio is received via dedicated audio ports - choose the option "Console Inbuilt Port".  MagicQ Pro 2014
consoles require the latest Pro 2014 kernel whilst MQ40, MQ60 and MQ70 require the latest firmware.

When using an external MagicQ USB Audio Interface then choose "ChamSys audio interface", "ChamSys audio left only" or "Energy only ChamSys audio".  When set to “ChamSys audio left only”, any signals received on the left
channel are automatically duplicated onto the right channel. This is useful in situations where only a mono audio feed is available.  When set to "Energy only ChamSys audio" all 14 received channels are averaged into one level and all MagicQ audio options will use this one level.

MagicQ supports global minimum and maximum audio levels to enable the levels to be matched to the received audio.  Both the Minium Audio Level and the Maximum Audio Level default to 0 indicating they have no effect.

The minimum is used to adjust for noise whilst the maximum can be set if the audio signal is particularly
weak.  When set to non zero values any levels below the minimum or above the maximum are ignored and the levels are scaled appropriately.

==== Cue Stack audio options

In the Cue Stack options there are 4 possible audio modes – Audio
Controls fader level, Audio bumps go, Audio sets BPM, Audio jumps Cue
Stack. Audio modes are not active until the Cue Stack is activated by
raising the fader or pressing the GO button.

Double click on the Audio channel to select the channel to respond to.
Audio level, audio parameter 1, and audio parameter 2 should be set to
0.

“Audio Controls fader level” enables the level of the fader to be
controlled by the received audio level on the chosen channel. In this
way you can control all sorts of different functions depending on how
you set the Fader options - HTP, LTP, FX Size, FX Speed etc... For
example, you could control the iris opening of a moving light by also
setting the Fader controls LTP (IPCB) chans option, or you could control
a Master Intensity fader. When using this mode, then Audio P1 and Audio
P2 can be set to control the response:

Audio P1 = 0 Normal (direct trigger from level)

Audio P1 = 1 Decayed (decays by Audio P2 each sample)

Audio P1 = 2 Pulse (triggers at Audio Level, Audio P2 is duration of
pulse)

Audio P1 = 3 Pulse decay (triggers at Audio Level, decays by Audio P2
each sample)

Audio P1 = 4 Switch (triggers to on/off at Audio Level)

Audio P1 = 5 Slow (increases/decreases by Audio P2 each sample)


“Audio bumps go” causes the Cue Stack to bump to the next step every
time a peak in the audio is detected on the specified channel. This
enables a Cue Stack to follow the beat of the music. This is best used
with the Cue Stack set to Cue Timing instead of Chase Timing. Audio
parameter 1 is used as a divider – set it between 2 and 16 to divide the
received beat frequency by a value between 2 and 16 times.

“Audio sets BPM” causes a Cue Stack set as a chase to automatically set
the chase speed to the timing of the peaks on the specified channel. The
Cue Stack should be set to Chase Timing.

“Audio jumps Cue Stack” enables the level of the specified channel to
determine which step in the Cue Stack is executed – for example if you
have a Cue Stack with 10 steps, then a level of 0% will execute step 1,
10% will execute step 2 whilst a level of 100% will execute step 10.
This is very useful if you wish to program different Cues onto LED or
media servers.

==== Pixel Mapper and Audio

The <<_pixel_map_audio_fx,Pixel Mapper Audio FX>> support comprehensive Pixel Mapping using audio triggering.
