== Controlling Media Servers
MagicQ is ideally suited to controlling media servers through its dedicated Media window - the eight encoder
wheels enable quick and easy access to a large numbers of control
parameters.

MagicQ has extremely powerful support for media servers. It is possible
to connect to up to 50 different media servers or intelligent media
yokes each with different media content. MagicQ downloads thumbnail
previews for the media content from each media server independently.

MagicQ supports a special window, solely for controlling media servers,
the Media Window. This window makes it much easier to control media
servers. You can select media server, media layer, attributes and media
content all from the same window. You can also see what content is
selected on each of the layers of the selected media server. Open the
Media Window pressing the Media button.

In addition, there is a Live Preview window, which shows the output of
the media server, or the output of each of the layers. This is
transferred is real time from the media server – so that you can see
exactly what the media server is playing. This is particularly useful in
situations with many media servers, or media servers that are remote
from the control position.

Media Servers are normally connected via network rather than DMX - this enables MagicQ to communicate with the media server to retrieve thumbnails and to show live previews.  MagicQ uses a network protocol such as Art-Net, Pathport or ACN to control the Media Server - this is set up in Setup, View DMX I/O.  In addition MagicQ uses a network protocol such as CITP MSEX or HMAP to communicate with the Media Server to retrieev thumbnails and live previews.

MagicQ supports many different types of Media Server including MagicHD - a free Media Player inbuilt into the MagicQ software.

=== Patching Media Servers on MagicQ

Media servers generally consist of a number of layers of one or more
types. Each type of layer has a different personality. Each layer is
treated as a different head on MagicQ with a different head number. To
patch a media server each of the layers must be patched in turn on
asscending DMX addresses.

On MagicQ it is possible to patch the media server in one go by using
the Choose DIM/MEDIA soft button. This gives a choice of the media
servers in their most common configurations. Patching using this method
patches all the required layers of different types and configures the
media server settings for one media server all in one action.

If your media server is not in the list of media servers then you will
need to patch the layers individually as you would for a moving light.
MagicQ includes demo show files for most common media servers – try loading these demo shows to see examples of the patch
required.

Each media server should have unique head numbers.  The layers in the media server should have asscending head numbers.


=== Connecting via network

Connect the Media Server to MagicQ using a network cable.

Ensure that the Media server and the MagicQ system are using IP addresses in the same network range - for example if using Art-Net then the media servers and MagicQ should all be on the 2.x.x.x or the 10.x.x.x network range.

To check the IP settings you can try and "ping" from MagicQ to the Media Server.  On MagicQ keyboard type three dots followed by the IP address to ping.

. . . a . b. c . d

where a.b.c.d is the IP address of the Media Server

The ping should show a “Reply from 2.x.x.x”. If you do not get a reply
then check the physical connection, check the configuration of the
network port on the media server and check there is no firewall software
on the media server.

==== Setting up control of the Media Server

In Setup, View DMX I/O configure the MagicQ universe where the Media Server is patched.  Set up the Output type to be the appropriate protocol - e.g. Art-Net, Pathport or ACN.

Ensure that the Output Universe is set up to the same as the Media Server - e.g. if the Media Server is using Art-Net 0-4 then set up the Output Universe on MagicQ to Art-Net and 4.

Enable the universe.  The Media Server should now respond to commands from MagicQ.

=== Configuring MagicQ to retrive thumbnails

In the Setup Window, Media View configure the media server parameters.
If you have patched using the Choose Media Server method above then the
parameters should mostly be set up correctly for you. It is only
neccesary to enter the IP address of the media server.

Set the IP address of the media server. This will be used to locate the
media server on the network and to retrieve thumbnails and live
previews.   Move to the IP address field and set the IP address. If you have only one media server active on the network then pressing enter should detect its IP address automatically.
Note that the media server will respond to commands over Art-Net, Pathport or ACN regardless of whether the IP address of the Media Server is set up correctly in MagicQ.

To determine the IP address of media server on Windows XP machines,
load the Control Panel, and open the Network Connections screen. Double
click on the network connection, choose the support tab, and the IP
Address is displayed.

Select the type of media server and the version:

Set the number of layers you have patched – this is the number of media
layers, and does not include master layers, soft edge or camera layers.

Set the head number of the first media layer. This tells MagicQ which
patched layer is the first media layer on the media server. MagicQ
expects layers to be sequential head numbers, e.g. set you head numbers
for your layers to 1 to 8.


==== MagicHD

MagicHD is fully integrated with MagicQ.  Set the Media Server type to MagicHD.  Set the version number to 0.

If MagicHD is being run from within MagicQ then set the Media Server IP address to 0 - this will appear as "Local".  MagicHD will use the thumbnails for the media from the PC/Mac that it is running on.

If you wish to connect to a MagicHD system on another PC, Mac or a MagicHD Box then set the Media Server IP address to the IP address of the external MagicHD system.

==== Arkaos

For Arkaos 3.6 and above and Media Master choose MSEX (Arkaos). For
Arkaos 3.5 select Arkaos. Set the version number to 0. Arkaos supports 8
layers.

Arkaos uses MSEX protocol for retrieval of thumbnails, part of CITP protocol stack.

MagicQ includes the mediamasterdemo.shw in the demos folder.

==== Catalyst

Select Catalyst and set the version number to 0.  Thumbnails are retrieved from Catalyst using html to the inbuilt Mac web server.  Catalyst does not support live preivews.

==== Coolux

Select Coolux and set the version number to 0. The number of layers
should be set to the total number of layers patched.

Arkaos uses MSEX protocol for retrieval of thumbnails, part of CITP protocol stack.  In Setup, View Media, the Coolux option is the same as the MSEX option.

==== Hippotizer

Hippotizers now support MSEX - this is the recommended protocol to use.

For older Hippotizer choose either Hippo Stage or Hippo Express depending on
which type you are using. For Hippo HD use Hippos Stage. Set the version
field according to the version, 2 for Hippo v2, 3 for Hippo v3.

==== Maxedia

For Maxedia choose MSEX and set the version number to 0.

==== Mbox

For Mbox choose Mbox and set the version number to 0.

Note that the head numbers for the text and object layers are allocated
lower numbers than the ancillary layers such as the ambient, spots,
camera, shutter and keystone. This ensures that the text and object
layers appear before the ancillary layers in the Media Window.

There is a pre-patched show mboxdemo.shw containing 5 layers and several cues to demonstrate
the Mbox EXtreme in the demos folder.

==== Other Media Servers

MagicQ supports the MSEX (Media Server Exchange) protocol which enables
it to communicate with any media servers that support this protocol.
Select MSEX (Arkaos) and set the version number to 0.

MagicQ also supports a generic protocol based on accessing the media
folder of a media server and a generic csv index file to determine the
mapping of thumbnails files to DMX values. Select “Generic” and set the
version number to 0.

=== Thumbnail view

MagicQ retrieves thumbnails from the media server and shows them on the
screen for easy selection of media banks and media images. The media
server must be enabled in the Setup Window, Media View for it to
retrieve thumbnails. MagicQ can handle different media on each media
server thus making it easy to program larger configurations of media
servers.

Thumbnail support is available when using Arkaos, Coolux Pandoras Box,
Catalyst, Hippotizer, Mbox, Maxcedia and any other media servers that
support the MSEX or generic protocols.

To retrieve thumnails press the GET THUMBS soft button in Setup, View System, View Media.
This grabs all the thumbnails for the media server which
the cursor is on.

To force a reload of all the media from the media server, move the
cursor to the required media server in the Media View of the Setup
Window and press the ERASE CACHE soft button. Then press the GET THUMBS
soft button to retrieve the new thumbs.

Individual pages of thumbs can be reloaded in the Media Window using the
RELOAD THUMBS soft button. Press SHIFT and RELOAD ALL THUMBS to reload
all pages.


=== Live Previews

MagicQ can connect to a media server to retrieve a live preview of the
master output or of the individual layers. This is very useful where the
media server is remote to the console, or in a multiple media server
configuration.

Live Preview support is available when using MagicHD, Arkaos and Hippotizer and
any other media server that supports the live preview part of the MSEX
protocol specification.

Enable the Live Preview option in the Media View of the Setup Window.

The live preview is shown in the large window on the left of the Media
Window. Choose using the top soft buttons whether the preview shows the
output, or the currently selected layer.

When connected to media servers that do not yet support live previews,
the preview window will show the image thumbnail from the 1^st^ layer
that has its intensity channel above zero.


=== Media Window View

It is possible to configure the View in the Media Window – View Servers
(defaults), View Groups, View Libraries and View Outputs. View Groups is useful when
using a large number of media servers and controlling using groups of
media servers rather than individual servers.

View Outputs shows a summary of the Output of all the configured Media Servers.

MagicQ automatically expands the Media Window to show the maximum number of layers that are in use by the configured Media Servers.

=== Using MagicQ and Media Server software on the same PC

==== Using MagicHD

MagicQ supports the inbuilt Media Player MagicHD.  This is fully integrated with MagicQ and can be used to play back media to a 2nd monitor attached to your MagicQ PC/Mac.

From the toolbar select Media Player, View Media Output and a MagicHD window will be opened.

==== Using the loopback IP address

It is possible to use MagicQ and 3rd party Media Server software (e.g. ArKaos) on
the same PC by altering some of the settings given above. In the Media
View of the Setup Window, set the IP address of the media server to
127.0.0.1. This is the local loopback IP address and will allow the PC
to talk to itself to retrieve thumbnails and live previews.

In the Settings View of the Setup Window, scroll down to Interface
Settings. Set the option for Send to Applications on this PC to YES.

With the loopback IP and Send to Applications set correctly, you should
be able to control your mredia server and use the live previews and
thumbnails.


=== Troubleshooting

If you do not have control of the Media Server check:

* MagicQ is connected to Media server via network
* There are no firewalls on - this will restrict access between the Media Server and MagicQ
* MagicQ is enabled to output either Art-Net, Pathport or ACN (Setup, View DMX I/O)
* The media server is configured to the correct DMX universe and address
* MagicQ is patched with the correct personalities at the correct addresses
