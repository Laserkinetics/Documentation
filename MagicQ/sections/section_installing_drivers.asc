== Installing MagicQ Software & Drivers

=== MagicQ software

MagicQ software runs on PCs and Macs and can be downloaded free from the
ChamSys web site https://secure.chamsys.co.uk/download[www.chamsys.co.uk/download].

=== MagicDMX

MagicDMX devices do NOT need any additional drivers – they use HID drivers within the operating system.  Simply plug in the device and start MagicQ.

To confirm that the MagicDMX is operating correctly go to Setup, View System, View status, Interfaces.  The MagicDMX Status should say "Connected" and "DMX out".

MagicDMX is enabled as DMX output by default.  It can be disable/enabled from Setup, View Setings, Ports, MagicDMX.

When first plugged in the MagicDMX alternates green and orange LEDs every second.  When MagicQ is started and connects to the device then the green LED is on permanently and the orange flashes faster as it receives data from MagicQ.

=== MagicQ Wings & Interfaces

MagicQ Wings and MagicQ DMX interfaces (Dual DMX, Audio, MIDI/SMPTE) use a USB chipset made by FTDI which requires the installation of the correct drivers.  

After the drivers have been installed then MagicQ can be started and the Wing/Interface should be detected.  Ensure the setting “Setup, View Settings, Ports, MagicQ Wings & Interfaces” is set to “Yes (auto DMX)”

Note that the drivers for MagicQ Wings and MagicQ DMX interfaces ARE NOT applicable to MagicDMX Basic or MagicDMX Full.  Do not attempt to install drivers for MagicDMX.


=== MagicQ on Windows

On Windows the FTDI drivers for MagicQ Wings and MagicQ Interfaces must be installed manually as Windows is not able to detect the products correctly.  The MagicQ installation includes the drivers in the folder
 
C:\ProgramFiles\ChamSys Ltd\Magicq\MagicQ Wing Drivers.  On 64 bit systems MagicQ is installed in Program Files (x86) instead of Program Files.

Disconnect all MagicQ Wings and Interfaces except the one you are trying to install the driver for.

Open Device Manager.  This is found in different places depending on the version of Windows, but it can normally be accessed by opening Control Panel and then selecting System and Device Manager.

Device Manager lists all the devices on your system.  The MagicQ device is normally listed at the bottom under Universal Serial Bus Controllers but it may be under any other section.  It may be listed as a ChamSys or MagicQ device or just as a FTDI device.  If you can not find it then try disconnecting and reconnecting the USB cable to the device - the listing should update and indicate to you which device is being plugged/unplugged.

When you have identified the device then right click and press Update Driver.

Select "Browse My Computer for Driver Software (Locate and Install Driver Software Manually)".  Do not let Windows search for a driver.

For PC Wing Compacts the drivers are in
c:\Program Files\ChamSys Ltd\Magicq\MagicQ Wing Drivers\PC Wing Compact\CDM 2.08.24 WHQL Certified\ftdibus.inf

PC Wing Compacts require MagicQ software version 1.5.8.0 or above.

For all other products the drivers are in 
c:\Program Files\ChamSys Ltd\Magicq\MagicQ Wing Drivers\FTDI\chamsys.inf

=== MagicQ on Mac

MagicQ on Mac includes all the required drivers and no action should be required to install them.  MagicQ Wings and Interfaces must be powered up and connected to the Mac before MagicQ is started.

On OSX 10.9 Mavericks you may need to move the mouse pointer whilst MagicQ is starting to avoid a problem in OSX whereby the mouse/keyboard become unresponsive.

Due to Apple compatibility issues, MagicQ version 1.5.9.9 or higher is required when running on OSX 10.9 Mavericks.

We recommend you disable Computer sleep and turn off App Nap to avoid MagicQ being shutdown inadvertently.

==== Turning off App Nap

* Quit MagicQ
* From the OSX Finder, navigate to the /Applications/MagicQ folder
* Select MagicQ.app, then go to the “File” menu and select “Get Info” (or select the app and hit Command+i) 
* Check the box for “Prevent App Nap”, found under the General section of Get Info

=== MagicQ on Linux

We recommend that only users familiar with Linux based operating systems try to use MagicQ under Linux. We cannot provide generic support on how to set your system up, but there are many forums and communities online which will be able to.

To install MagicQ on Linux based systems, we recommend a Debian based operating system, either Debian Wheezy, or Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

To use MagicQ Wings and MagicQ Interfaces Linux requires the ftdi_sio kernel driver which is included as part of most standard kernel installations.

There are two ways to install MagicQ, either through an apt repository, where you can get automatic updates, or by manually downloading the installer.

To install using the repository to your system, run the following command to add our public key to your apt keystore

`wget http://repo.magicq.co.uk/magicq.co.uk.gpg -qO - | sudo apt-key add -`

Then add the following line to the bottom of your /etc/apt/sources.list file:

`deb http://repo.magicq.co.uk/magicq/ magicq main`

Update your package list in apt by running `apt-get update`, then you can install MagicQ by running 'apt-get install magicq'. If you wish to follow our beta release channel, then use `apt-get install magicq-beta` instead.

To run MagicQ, simply goto your launcher menu, and select "MagicQ". Currently MagicQ will need root permissions to run to be able to access any USB interfaces.
