== Timecode Support
MagicQ supports both time code decode and time code generation.

MagicQ MQ70 and MQ100 Pro 2014 consoles have inbuilt support for Timecode.  All other MagicQ systems require connection to an external MagicQ MIDI/Timecode interface.

MagicQ does not support timecode via 3rd party PC MIDI interfaces or through the
phone (rca) interfaces on MagicQ consoles.

Cue Stacks can be set up to run Cues according to timecode signals
received from external sources via LTC or MIDI timecode. They can also
be set up to use an Internal timecode source which is activated from
0:0:0 when the Cue Stack is activated.


=== Timecode Decode

MagicQ supports decode of both linear time code (LTC) and MIDI time code.

Set the Timecode Decode to LTC or MIDI.  Timecode Generation should be set to None.

The time-code type can be set to EBU-25, SMPTE30, NTSC30 and Film 24.
When a MagicQ MIDI/Timecode module is fitted the Status Display will show
the current time-code being received.

The time-code continue frames is the number of frames to continue
internal regeneration of the time-code signal when it is lost. After
this time the time-code will be frozen until a signal is received again.

Time code can be triggered from an external time code source using
the MagicQ MIDI/Timecode module, or it can run from the internal
time code source. To control a Cue Stack using external time code set
the “External time code” option in the Cue Stack options.

Cues can be set to time code by changing the Halt field in the Cue Stack
window (double click on it or press SHIFT + ENTER.

When a Cue Stack that contains time code cues is activated the time code
takes control of the Cue Stack and each Cue executes at the time code
specified. For Internally generated time code, activating the Cue Stack
starts the time code at 0/0/0. For external time code the time code will
be read from the external module.


=== Enabling / Disabling Timecode

It is possible to turn timecode decode on and off for a Cue Stack using soft
button A in the Cue Stack Window. When timecode is turned off the Cue
Stack will not execute timecode Cues. When turned on it will execute
timecode Cues according to the Internal/External setting.

Press SHIFT + soft button A to avoid the confirmation request.

It is also possible to change the Cue Stack from Internal to External
timecode using the soft button C. Press SHIFT + soft button C to avoid
the confirmation request.

There is support for setting the internal timecode from within a Cue
Stack using the macro command ‘I’. To reset the internal timecode for a
Cue Stack to 0/0/0.0 use the macro I0. To set a specific time, e.g. 10
seconds use the macro I10.


=== Using External Timecode

Cue Stacks must be active before external timecode will take effect on
the Cue Stack. In some cases it may be useful to have a master Cue Stack
controlled by timecode that is always active which then activates other
Cue Stacks for each song.

When timecode values jump (for example when changing tracks), MagicQ
checks for each active Cue Stack, whether the external timecode received
is within the range of the first timecode value in the Cue Stack and the
last timecode value in the Cue Stack. MagicQ will only execute a change
of Cue if the new value is within the range controlled by that Cue
Stack. This helps to avoid the erroneous execution of an entire Cue
Stack.


=== Timecode Simulator

MagicQ includes a powerful timecode simulator for simulating external
timecode when an external timecode source is not available. In the Setup
Window, the simulator is turned on using soft button Y. When the
simulator is on, then any received external timecode is ignored.

The timecode start value can be set by entering a timecode value and
pressing the X soft button. The X soft button is also used to start and
stop the timecode running.

Entering a new timecode value whilst the timecode simulator is running
will jump directly to the new value and continue running.

Typing * before pressing the X button will restart from the last entered
timecode.


=== Learn Timing

It is possible for the console to learn the timing live. Set the steps
in the Cue Stack to time code. Then release the Cue Stack, and in the
Cue Stack window, press SHIFT and RECORD TC. Now press the GO button for
the Cue Stack. MagicQ starts the time code running at 0/0/0 and each
time you press GO it moves to the next Cue whilst recording the current
time code into the Wait fields. At the end of the Cue Stack, press
RELEASE to exit the time code record mode.

Time code values can be edited individually and can be set in the format
0/0/0.00. The + and – operators can be used to add or subtract times to
the time code times for one or more cues. This is useful for changing
the absolute times of a Cue Stack whilst maintaining the relative times
between Cues. Use SHIFT or CTRL and the cursor keys to select multiple
times and offset their values using + or -.


=== Timecode Generation

MagicQ can also master time code. Set Timecode generation to LTC or MIDI.  Tiemcode Decode shopuld be set to None.

There are special macro field commands to enable time code mastering and
to set the time code value.

W <enable> Enable / disable time code generation (1 for enable, 0 for
disable)

Q <time code> Set current time code (also enables time code generation)

For example to set timecode to 0:0:10:0

Q0,0,10,0


=== Timecode Re-transmit

The LTC or MIDI timecode decoded from a MagicQ MIDI/Timecode interface
can be retransmitted over the network as Art-Net timecode.
