== Execute Window
The Execute Window is a special window designed to allow customisation of the look and feel of the MagicQ. This layout of the window is
configurable by the user and can contain Groups, Palettes, Macros, Cues
and Cue Stacks. It is also automatically accesible on the MagicQ remote
iOS and Android applications.

There are three views, View Design, View Execute and View Max. Use View Design to
design the grid size and to place items in the grid. Use View Execute
for playback, or View Max for full screen playback.

=== Design View

Use the Set Grid Size soft button to specify a grid size and then copy the relevant items from other windows. For
example, to place a Group in the Execute Window; go to the Group Window,
press Copy, select the Group, and then go to the Execute Window and
select the box to place the Group.

Cues and Cue Stacks can be recorded directly into the Execute Window
using Record and selecting a free item.

Multiple items can be selected for copying into the Execute Window.

You can also assign Special Functions to items in the Execute grid.
These include Execute Page Up, Execute Page Down, Change to Exec Page,
Close, Blind, Clear, Lamp On, Lamp Off, Reset, Key Lock. Press the
ASSIGN SPECIAL soft button.

There are special functions for controlling zones – enabling,
disabling and setting the hot takeover state. These enable complete
control of complex DMX routing from a simple interface.

To view the details of an item in the Execute Window use the View Item soft button. This makes it easy to change FX and Chase
speed quickly.


=== Full Screen View

The Execute Window can be run in full-screen mode, allowing the
whole of the screen to be customised. The size of the full screen Execute Window can be set via
the Set Win Size button – this defaults to 1024 by 768 for MagicQ PC/Mac and
800 by 600 for the console.

Selecting the “Run in Execute Window” option in the Setup Window ensures that the MagicQ will start up directly in the Execute Window. Note that on MagicQ PC/Mac, the buttons
on the full screen Execute Window will only work when a MagicQ PC Wing
is connected.

By default the Execute Window does not have a close button - clicking any empty item will return to the normal MagicQ windows.  Use Assign Special to add a specific Close button into the Execute Grid. On MagicQ consoles you can press the CLOSE button to return to normal MagicQ windows.

=== Password Protection

It is possible to protect the Execute Window so that operators only
see the Execute Window and can not use the main MagicQ application
windows. From the Execute Window set up a password using the Set
Password soft button. If an operator tries to close the window then they
have the choice of shutting down or entering the password to re-enter
the main MagicQ application windows.

For security reasons there is not a master password. To reset the
password that is locked, please contact your local dealer.

Protection can be added so that users cannot operate any Execute buttons
until they enter a password. A “Key Lock” Special Function button can be
placed in the Execute Window. When pressed the Execute Window is locked
and can only be unlocked by entering the password. If no password has
been set, then entering a blank password will unlock the window.

=== Automated Start

MagicQ includes several options for automated start of Playbacks and
Executes. These options are available on MagicQ consoles and on MagicQ
PC systems when connected to a MagicQ USB Wing or Interface. See Setup,
View Settings, Playback, Activate Playbacks On Start.


=== Faders

The Execute Window supports faders as well as buttons. Cue Stacks
and Cues can be represented as faders. To set a Cue Stack or Cue as a
fader, move the cursor to the item and press SOFT button E to toggle
between button and fader. A ‘F’ appears in the corner of the item when
it is set to be a fader. Faders are only shown in Execute View and Max View, not in
Design View.

Faders can be twice as tall as buttons. When setting faders in the
Execute Window leave the box below the fader free. The fader will
automatically be adjusted in the Excute View to fill the two boxes.


=== Buttons

By default buttons in the Execute Window are set to toggle their
function on and off each time the button is pressed. It is possible to
set a button in the Execute Window that is controlling a Cue or a Cue
Stack to momentary rather than toggling. Move the cursor to the required
item and use Soft button E to set the item type “Button Fl”.

Buttons can also be set as solo buttons (also known as radio buttons) so
that a group of buttons programmed as Cues or Cue Stacks can be set so
that only one of the group is active at a time. Use soft button E to
select “Solo”.

The group consists of all adjacent buttons in a horizontal row that have
their “Item Type” set to “Solo”. “Solo” buttons must be immediately
adjacent. Empty items or items that are not set to “Solo” will end the
group.


=== Button appearance

The appearance of the boxes can be set using Soft button B “Appearance”.
The options are "Images", “Boxes” or “Coloured” for the appearance of
the buttons, faders and encoders. "Images" uses inbuilt images whilst
"Coloured" colours the buttons according to function.  When that function is active the button appears brighter.

The Execute Window supports custom images for the buttons, faders and
encoders. The images should be stored in the bitmaps folder and named
according to:

|===
|Button up image|xxxxup.bmp
|Button down image|xxxxdn.bmp
|Fader track image|xxxxtrck.bmp
|Fader knob image|xxxxknob.bmp
|Encoder back image|xxxxbase.bmp
|Encoder dial image|xxxxdial.bmp
|===

Where xxxx is any name. The images can be bmp, jpeg or png. The bitmaps
can be selected for each item in the Execute Window, View Design by
pressing the BUTTON BITMAP soft button and selecting the required image
file.

When selecting the file, choose the “up”, "trck" or "base" file. MagicQ
will automatically substitute the “dn” file when the button is active.

Use SHIFT + CLEAR BITMAP to remove the bitmap.


=== Speed Encoders

The Execute Window supports encoders for speed control of Cue Stacks.
Use Insert Special, and select Encoder to insert an encoder below a
recorded Cue Stack. The Encoder will only be active when the Cue Stack
directly above is active.

=== Wallpaper

It is possible to set a background wallpaper using the SET WALLPAPER
soft button. The wallpaper should be a bmp or jpeg of the size set by
the WIN SIZE button. For MagicQ consoles the internal touch screen is
800x600 resolution.

Use SHIFT + CLR WALLPAPER to remove the wallpaper.

=== Automating Setup options

Setup options can be changed from the Execute Window without having to write keyboard macros.  In the Execute Window – press ASSIGN SPECIAL and select Setup Option in
order to assign the changing of a Setup Option to a single button.

=== Execute Window on ioS/Android remote

Execute windows are automatically available on the iOS/Android remote apps.

Each iOS/Android device can access different Execute Pages on the MagicQ system.  We recommend using the Execute Page Up, Execute Page Down, Change to Exec Page special functions to enable page selection on remote devices.

The ioS/Android device downloads any custom images used in the Execute Window from the MagicQ system.
