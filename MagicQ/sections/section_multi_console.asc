== Manual configuration of Multi Console operation

From software version 1.5.9.4 we recommend you use network sessions to
control hot take-over, show synchronisation and playback synchronisation.
However it can be configured manually as below.


=== Manual configuratuion of Hot take-over

Hot take-over allows the use of multiple consoles in case a console
stops working. Hot take-over can be used in two ways - depending on what
you wish to happen when the main console becomes available again.

In “Preferred mode” only one of the consoles (or MagicQ PCs) on the
network is designated as a back up. All the universes on the console are
set to “Hot take-over”. Whenever there is no ArtNet traffic on the
network for a particular universe, the back-up console starts sending
data for that universe. As soon as data reappears, the back-up console
stops sending data.

In “Equal mode” all consoles on the network are set to “Hot take-over”.
At any one time, one of the consoles will run as the master, with all
universes enabled. If that console fails, one of the others will take
over. It is recommended that you set the “Hot take-over detect time” to
different values on each of the consoles to avoid conflict conditions.

The first console to start is the Master and outputs ArtNet. The other
console becomes the Slave.


==== Hot Takeover Mode

Hot Takeover Mode is set in Setup, View Settings, Multi Console. The
options are:

* Pref Master Console will always be Master
* Pref Slave Console will only be Master if another console is not detected
* Equal Both consoles have same priority
* Split Universes controlled independently. (default)

For all modes it is still necessary to set up Setup, View DMX I/O so that all universes that
you wish to use as Hot Takeover have their Output and Input universes
and type set correctly.

When you set a universe to “Hot Takeover” you must ensure that Input is
enabled on that Universe and that it is set to the correct type and
universe number – generally the Input should be set up the same as the
Output.

When using “Hot take-over” on MagicQ PC, ensure that the IP address of
MagicQ PC (set up in Setup Window, View Settings) is set to the valid IP
address of the network you are using. If this setting is incorrect then
Hot Takeover will not work correctly.


_Preferred Mode_

Setting one console to Preferred Master and the other to Preferred Slave
operates a Master/Slave mode whereby one console will always be the
Master, with the other console only taking control when that Preferred
Master console is not available (shutdown, reset, disconnected from the
network). As soon as the Preferred Master restarts or is connected back
on the network then it will take control and the Preferred Slave will
stop outputting.

All required universes on both consoles should be set to Hot Takeover.


_Equal Mode_

Setting both consoles to Equal operates a Master/Slave mode whereby both
Consoles have the same precedence. The first console to start becomes
the Master. Take Control and Release Control can be used to swap which
console is the Master.

All Universes are treated the same – enabling / disabling together. For
systems which require hot takeover to operate independently on different
Universes the Split mode should be used.

If the network cable between the consoles is broken then neither console
will see the other console and both will become Master. If one of the
consoles is still connected to the lighting rig then it will have
control – both consoles will not be connected to the lighting rig –
otherwise the consoles would see each other.

When the network between the consoles is reconnected then both consoles
will detect the other consoles at the same instance. The console with
the lower IP address will become the Master.

All required universes on both consoles should be set to Hot Takeover.


_Split Mode_

This mode makes the consoles operate as in previous version of software.
Set Hot Takeover in Setup, View DMX I/O for the required Universes.

To make a single system a backup for another system set the universes to
Hot Takeover only on the slave console. For a Master/Slave system with
equal precedence, set the universes to Hot Takeover on both systems.


==== Hot take-over type

image:images/dmxiohottakeover.png[image]

The hot take-over type can be set to manual or automatic. When set to
manual the output is frozen until the operator decides what new look to change to. In automatic, a gradual fade is made
to the look set on the Playbacks – in this mode an operator will often
put up a “safe” state on the standby console which can be used if the
main console has a problem.

In manual mode, when MagicQ determines that it should take over a
universe it will load a snapshot of the last data from that universe
into its Programmer. The universe will be completely controlled
from within the Programmer and not from the Playbacks. The operator can
then set up the playbacks as they wish and then clear the programmer to
change to this new look. Clearing the programmer with time enables the
operator to specify a fade time to the new look.

In automatic mode, MagicQ loads the snapshot of the last data from that
universe into the Programmer and then automatically clears the
programmer using the hot-takeover fade time.

Since both options use the programmer, it is recommended that the
programmer is kept clear on the standby console.


==== Swapping control between multiple consoles

In Equal Mode, a console that is set to “Hot take-over” can be forced to
control all universes using the “TAKE CONTROL” soft button. This will
force an immediate change of control from one console to the other.

Similarly, control can be given to another console using the “RELEASE
CONTROL” soft button. This will force the other console to take control,
and depending on the hot take-over options will enable a controlled fade
to the new console outputs.

Note that the “TAKE CONTROL” and “RELEASE CONTROL” are only active when
one or more universes are set to “Hot take-over”.

When universes on MagicQ consoles are set to hot-takeover then the
current Master / Slave status is shown in the Status Display underneath
the date and time.

Note that a MagicQ console is considered a Master if any of the universes
that are configured as a hot takeover universe are currently enabled and
hence outputting to the network. A MagicQ console is considered a Slave
if all universes that are configured as hot takeover universes are
currently disabled – the console is not outputting to the network on
these universes.


=== Manual configuration of Playback synchronisation

It is possible to carry out basic synchronisation of two or more
consoles during playback by using the ChamSys Remote protocol – either
via serial or Ethernet. Synchronisation can be set for individual
playbacks, or for all 10 main playbacks. When the playbacks faders are
raised, playbacks Go, Back or Jump are pressed, the master console sends
ChamSys Remote Protocol commands to the slave consoles.

Synchronisation on MagicQ PC is only available when connected to a
MagicQ Wing or MagicQ Interface.


==== Configuration

On all units that will be master units set the “Playback Sync type”
option.

The Setup option “Playback Sync Type” has the options:

* None: No synchronisation information is sent
* Swap DBO Swap, DBO info only
* Page Page changes only
* Enhanced Playback Enhanced sync protocol (recommended)
* Slave Slave (receive sync only)
* Wings Wing data only (no data is sent for PB1 to PB10)
* Obsolete (was Pb) Obsolete Playback info only mode
* Obsolete (was PB,Swap,DBO) Obsolete Playback, Swap, DBO mode

We strongly recommend you use Enhanced as this is more reliable on
heavily loaded networks.

Therefore MaicQ systems can be set to track the playback exactly or just to honour
DBO and Swap status. This means that, for example, when using two
consoles, one for generic lights and one intelligent lights – pressing a
Swap button on one console will affect both consoles.

It is possible to synchronise with other (non MagicQ) consoles or
external computers that support ChamSys Remote Ethernet Protocol.


==== Configuring which consoles Playback sync to which consoles

When there are multiple consoles on a network, it may be that consoles
are controlling different network universes and therefore there may be
more than one master console sending synchronisation information on the
network.

It is possible to set a MagicQ console to only accept synchronisation
information from a particular console. In Multi Console Settings,
“Playback Sync IP” enter the IP address of the console to accept
synchronisation from. A value of 0.0.0.0 indicates that it will accept
synchronisation from any console on the network.


=== Manual configuration of Show Data Synchronisation

From software version 1.5.9.4 we recommend you use network sessions –
all consoles in the network session are automatically configured for
multi console programming. No further configuration is needed.

MagicQ supports show file synchronisation in a network. One console is
designated as the “Master Prog” console which will keep the master show
file.

The synchronisation of show data is separate to synchronisation of show
playback state and hot takeover. Regardless of which console is actually
controlling the universes the Master Prog console will remain in control
of the master show file.

When a Slave Prog console starts or is reset it makes a connection to
the Master Prog console and tries to synchronise to the show master
data. This consists of automatically grabbing the show data file from
the show master and loading that show data file into the show slave.
Users can also request a resynchronise at any time.

Configure the master console by setting the multi console setting “Show
data sync type” to “Master Prog”.

On each of the slave consoles set the “Show data sync type” option to
“Slave Prog” and set the “Show data sync IP” to the IP address of the
master show console.

There are hot keys on the slave consoles to enable and disable the show
sync (as set up in Setup, View Settings, Multi Console). Hold the left
and right cursor keys and press ‘+’ to enable the show sync and hold
left and right cursor keys and press ‘-‘ to disable the show sync.

To turn off show synchronisation on the master console simply set the
Show Data Sync Type to None.


=== Manual configuration of Selective Channel Control

From software version 1.5.9.4 we recommend you use network sessions to
configure selective channel control. In a network session all slave
consoles can access channels from the master console by View DMX I/O,
Multi Prog Select described in the next section.

If consoles are manually set up for multi programming by setting Show
data sync to Master Prog and Slave Prog then selective channel control
is automatically enabled.

Selective channel control can also be used without multi programming.
This gives slave consoles access to control part of a lighting rig (e.g.
for a technician to test some lights) but does not give them the ability
to change any of the stored show data. To configure this mode, set Show
data sync type on the master to “Master Control” and on the slaves to
“Slave Control.”

Note that when network sessions are not in use, each console operates as
a separate console in terms of the DMX I/O settings – so for example if
you were to enable the universes on each of the consoles then there
would be a “fight” between the consoles. Universes must be enabled /
disabled manually on each console or set to hot takeover.


=== Automatic backing up of shows from other consoles

It is possible to set a MagicQ console or a MagicQ PC to automatically
back up show files from one or more other consoles on the network.
Optionally, this console can be made to automatically run one of the
shows.

Warning - if this option is configured incorrectly then your show
files could get accidentally overwritten. Always back up your show files
to external media / computer systems.

In the Setup Window, View Settings, Multi Console configure the “Show
sync type” option to “Archive”.

When set to “Archive”, MagicQ periodically checks for other consoles on
the network and grabs the show files that are running on those consoles.
The show files are stored in the normal show folder.

When this feature is used to back-up multiple consoles, it is important
that different show file names are used on each of the other consoles –
otherwise files from different consoles will overwrite each other on the
back-up console.

Note that files will only be copied from consoles that have the “auto
backup” option set to “yes” or “on changes”. Files will not be copied
from consoles that do not have this set (e.g. when the playback mode is
set to “Safe”). This avoids any performance impact from copying of files
from live consoles.

When set to “Show Sync” MagicQ copies the files as above. It will then
load one of the shows that it has copied. If there are multiple consoles
on the network then it will always run the show file from the same
console.

This feature can be used to back up show files from PCs running MagicQ
PC as well as from consoles – these PCs must have the drive where MagicQ
is installed shared on the network (e.g. share C: as C).
