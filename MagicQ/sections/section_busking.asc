== Live Programming (Busking)
=== Adding individual channels using preset faders

Individual channels can be added into the show as required using the
Intensities Windows. Channels can be added using the faders in either
the Programmer View or the Presets View.

Channels added in the Programmer View are added into the programmer in
the usual way. If the programmer is cleared then they are cleared.
Channels added using the Presets View are not affected by operations on
the programmer - they act like preset faders.

Channels added in both views are affected by the Grand Master and by the
pressing of SWAP buttons.


=== Over-ride / take-over

The MagicQ architecture supports the combined use of the programmer, playbacks and preset faders so that there is no need to
constantly swap between modes, losing your overridden effects. This makes the console ideal for busking shows.

ADD and SWAP buttons work regardless of whether you are programming or
playing back. Similarly the programmer works as an over-ride, regardless
of what you are doing.

By default, the console makes no distinction between programming and run
modes. Some operators may wish to restrict what is allowed in run mode –
this can be configured in the Setup Window. You can choose to disable
programming or to disable modification of programmed Cues / Cue Stacks.


=== Viewing Cues and Cue Stacks

The Cue and Cue Stack Windows are used to monitor and adjust the
execution of Cues and Cue Stacks respectively.  Both windows
monitor the currently selected playback.

For a Cue Stack with a single Cue recorded on it, then the Cue Stack
window will not be of much interest. In this case the Cue can be
monitored and adjusted using the Cue Window.

For a Cue Stack with multiple Cues, the Cue Stack window can be used to
watch the progress of the Cue Stack. The position within the Cue Stack
can be changed along with the timing information. You can make the Cue
Stack window follow the Cue currently executing on the selected playback
- set the Display Current Cue option to YES in the Cue Stack Window.


=== Modifying chase speed / contrast

To modify the speed or contrast of a Cue Stack that is running with
Chase Timing, press the SELECT button for the playback, and then adjust
the encoders in the Cue Stack Window. The chase direction and chase type
(Normal, Bounce, Random) can also be selected. Pressing and holding the
SELECT button of a Playback with a chase on it automatically opens the
Cue Stack Window.

Use the top right encoder to modify individual attributes - Position,
Beam, Colour, Intensity In and Intensity Out (soft button selects the
different attributes). Once the speed of an attribute is changed it is
no longer controlled by the master chase speed. Modifying the attribute
so that it is the same as the master chase speed brings it back under
control of the master chase speed.

Modifications are retained even after the playback is released.


=== Modifying FX parameters

To modify the parameters of a FX that is programmed in a Cue, press the
SELECT button for the playback, and then adjust the encoders in the Cue
Window.

FX size, shape, spread and speed are all adjustable.

Modifications are retained even after the playback is released.


=== Stop / Starting Cue Stacks

Cue Stacks can be started and stopped using the GO and STOP buttons
associated with the playback.

For wing playbacks, make the playback the current playback and then
press the GO / STOP buttons in the manual control section.


=== Jumping to a Cue in a Cue Stack

There are several ways to jump to a specific Cue in a Cue Stack.

Press the S button of the Playback, enter a Cue Id on the keypad and
press the manual GO button.

In the Cue Stack window, use the cursor keys or press the touch screen
to move the cursor to the required Cue. Press the GOTO CUE soft button
to jump directly to the Cue. Alternatively key in the Cue ID within the
Cue Stack of the Cue you wish to jump to and press GOTO CUE.

Pressing the PRELOAD CUE button rather than the GOTO CUE button selects
the Cue that will be executed when the GO button for the Cue Stack is
next pressed. This enables the next Cue to be selected in advance of the
Cue being required.

Pressing ENTER in the first column of the Cue Stack also jumps to the
specified Cue.


=== Over-riding using the programmer

When playing back a show, you can over-ride the programmed effect in the
playbacks by using the programmer. For instance, assume that you are
running a yellow circle on your MAC500s. You wish to change the colour
to Red.

Select the MAC500s from the Group Window.

In the Colour Window select the Red palette entry.

If you wish to remove the over-ride then you can either clear all off
the programmer by pressing CLEAR. Alternatively you can remove only
certain attributes or certain heads by selecting the items with the
cursor in the Prog Window and pressing the REMOVE soft button.

When you press CLEAR or remove selected heads from the programmer, the
programming will be immediately removed and the heads will be controlled
by the playbacks as if the programming had not been applied. This is
different to some other consoles where clearing the programmer has non
deterministic effects.

Note that in order to over-ride individual attributes of an intelligent
head you need to be in SELECT BY CHAN rather than SELECT BY HEAD mode.
If you are in SELECT BY HEAD mode then all of the head attributes will
be set to what is in the programmer.


=== Adding in new FX

MagicQ does not make a distinction between programming and run
modes so it is always possible to busk new FX. For instance, assume that
you have an active playback which has the MAC500s statically focused on
the centre vocals position. You now wish to temporarily add in a tilt
saw.

Select the MAC500s from the Group Window.

In the Prog Window, select the ADD FX soft button.

Select the TILT SAW FX.

Adjust the encoder wheels as appropriate.

If you wish to set the speed / size of the FX before you make it live on
stage, then go into BLIND mode before you ADD in the FX. Then you can
adjust the chase without affecting the stage output. Use the Move View
in the Outputs Window to get a 2D picture of how your FX will look. Then
when you are happy, go out of BLIND mode and the FX will appear on
stage.

Alternatively use the ADD FX ZERO SIZE soft button – this adds an FX
into the programmer exactly as when using the ADD FX soft button except
that the Zero Size option is set. You can then select the size you want
using the SIZE encoder before pressing the ZERO SIZE soft button to
clear the Zero Size option.

Use the CHANGE FX soft button to change the waveform of the FX live.

Pressing and releasing BLIND will enable you to busk the FX in and out –
e.g. in the chorus / verse transitions.


=== Applying palettes with time

Palettes can be applied with a time by simple entering a time in seconds
before selecting the palette entry to apply.

For example, to apply a 4.5 second movement from the current position to
your programmed centre vocals position, simply type 4.5 and select the
vocals position in the Position Window.

The fades are carried out in the programmer (you don’t need any
playbacks free). All attributes in the palette are faded regardless of
whether they are marked as instant or fading in the personality file.

If you apply a palette with time whilst in FAN mode then the times will
be fanned across the different heads in the order that the heads have
been selected. See <<_using_palettes_with_time,using palettes with
time>>.


=== Releasing / Clearing with time

Release times can be set on a per Cue Stack basis, in the Cue Stack
Options. Default release times can be set up in the Cue Stack, Defaults
view including times for Cue Stacks with single Cues and Cue Stacks with
multiple Cues.

It is also possible to release a Playback with time by typing a number
and then pressing REL. For example, 3 REL releases the currently
selected playback over 3 seconds.

In addition it is possible to clear the programmer and to enter and exit
blind mode with times. Press 5 CLEAR to clear the programmer over 5
seconds. Press 10 BLIND to enter blind mode over 10 seconds.


=== Busking Master

It is possible in the Setup Window to set the manual crossfade fader to
be a “busking rate” sub-master from 0 seconds to 10 seconds. The rate is
shown in the bottom right of the Status Display. The time is applied to
selection of palettes and intensities. When FAN mode is selected the
change is applied in turn across each of the selected heads.


=== Programmer Master

It is possible to make a Playback into a Programmer Master. Record an
empty Cue onto a Playback and then set the Cue Stack option, Function,
Programmer Master.

When the Playback is activated by pressing the GO button then the fader
level becomes the Programmer level. Releasing the fader level causes the
Programmer level to go back to 100%.

When the fader is less set to less than 100%, the FLASH button can be
used to bump in the Programmer at 100%.

The GO button and PAUSE buttons are used to swap Palette values in the
Programmer when the Programmer has mixed palette values.

For instance if some heads are set to use the RED palette in the
programmer and others using the GREEN palette then pressing GO will swap
all the heads using RED palette to use GREEN and all the heads using
GREEN palette to use RED.

If there are more than 2 colour Palettes in use in the Programmer, then
the colours rotate around all the different Palettes.

Odd/Even can be used to easily set up an initial look of 2 or more
colour palettes.

Currently only one Programmer Master can be active at a time.
