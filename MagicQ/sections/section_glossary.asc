Active

Function of loading all parameters for selected heads into the
programmer.

Art-Net

A protocol for transporting DMX over Ethernet LAN.

Attributes

Intelligent heads support a number of different functions that can be
controlled via DMX – typically pan, tilt, colour, gobo etc… Each of
these functions that can be controlled by a separate DMX channel is
referred to as an attribute.

Attribute Type

Attributes of intelligent heads are categorised into one of four types -
Intensity, Position, Colour, Beam.

Battery Back-up

The console supports battery back up, as an option. If fitted, this
ensures that if there is a temporary interruption to the console power
supply, the console continues to function. The battery will last for a
specified time (usually 15 minutes) before the power should be restored
or the console shut down.

Beam

An attribute type - attributes of an intelligent head that modify the
make up of the beam are categorised as beam attributes. Examples are the
shutter, iris, gobo wheels and prism wheels.

Calibration

A process of adjustment. Used on MagicQ to adjust the touch screen
so that touching the screen in a particular position gives an accurate
result.

Channel

The basic unit of control on the console. Each Universe has 512
channels.

Chase

A sequence of steps to modify channel values over time. On the MagicQ a
chase is made up of a sequence of Cues in a Cue Stack.

Colour

An attribute type - attributes of an intelligent head that modify the
colour of the beam are categorised as colour attributes. Examples are
colour wheels and colour mixing attributes.

Contrast

The Contrast for the wing LCD screens enables the viewing angle of the
screens to be modified.

Crossfade

Crossfade of a chase or an FX refers to how changes are made to the
output channels when moving from step to step of a chase or FX.

Crossfade of 100% indicates a smooth fade from one value to the next.
Crossfade of 0% indicates a snap from one value to the next.

Cue

The basic unit of storage on the console. A Cue stores level, timing and
FX information for a single look.

Cue Stack

A sequence of Cues that can be played in order.

Cue Store

A list of all the Cues stored on the console.

Cue Stack Store

A list of all the Cues Stacks stored on the console.

DBO

Dead Black Out. The DBO button when pressed causes all HTP channels to
be set to zero. On release all HTP channels are returned to their
previous values.

Console Lamp

Low voltage lamp which connects into the rear panel. Used to light up
the console surface. The console supports 2 or more console lamps
depending on the number of attached wings.

DMX

DMX512 protocol.

Encoder

Rotary dial used for easy control of parameters.

Ethernet

A method of connecting data equipment together in the form of a Local
Area Network (LAN).

Fan

Method of modifying parameters using encoders whereby different changes
are applied to the selected heads such that the parameter is fanned
across the heads.

File Manager

A Window used for organising show data stored on the MagicQ internal
disc and on external USB sticks.

Flip

For moving heads with 360 degree pan movement there is more than one
setting for the pan and tilt attributes for each physical position. Flip
modifies the pan and tilt attributes to the alternate settings.

FX

FX is short for EFFECTS. The FX generator enables complex variations to
be applied to parameters over time. For example a circle FX applied to
the position attributes of a moving head causes it to move in a circle.

Gel

Coloured film that is placed in front of lights to modify the colour of
the beam. The MagicQ stores a Gel colour for each dimmer, which makes
identification and programming easy.

Generic

A generic dimmer channel. A head with a single channel which controls a
dimmer from 0 to 100%.

Grand Master

The master fader which controls HTP levels for the entire console.

Gobo

A patterned object placed in front of a light source to modify the shape
of the beam. Intelligent heads typically contain one or more wheels of
gobos.

Head

An intelligent head

Include

Loading a Cue into the Programmer.

Intensity

An attribute type - the attribute of an intelligent head that controls
the intensity of the mean. Often referred to as the dimmer.

Keyboard

The console includes an external keyboard, which connects into a socket
on the back panel marked keyboard.

Keypad

The numerical keypad situation to the bottom left of the console. The
layout of the keypad is similar to that found on standard PC keyboards
with the addition of @, THRU and FULL buttons for quick control of lamp
intensities.
