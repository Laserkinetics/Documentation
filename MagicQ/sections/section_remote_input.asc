== Remote Input port

The MagicQ PC Wing, MagicQ MaxiWing and MagicQ consoles support a remote
input port on the rear panel, which can be used to trigger functions in
MagicQ from an external control device or switch. 

The remote trigger can be used to trigger Cues in Cues Stacks, to flash playbacks, as a master
GO button, or as a ADD/SWAP selector.


=== Connection (MagicQ Consoles, MagicQ PC Wing Compact and MagicQ MaxiWing)

The remote input is provided on a standard 4 pin mini DIN connector.

The connections are (in the sequence they appear physically on the
connector)

|===
|2|0V and equipment ground
|4|Opto isolated input negative
|3|Opto isolated input positive
|1|Power supply positive (5 Volt, current limited)
|===

The remote input can be used to receive an external signal on the opto
isolated inputs, or it can be wired to an external switch. To receive an
external signal wire the signal + to pin 3 and the signal – to pin 4.
When used as external optically isolated input the maximum continuous
voltage rating is 24V DC.

When wiring to an external switch links pins 2 and 4. Then connect the
external switch between pins 3 and 1.

=== Connection (Original PC Wing)

On the original PC Wing the remote input is provided on a standard 5 pin 180
degree DIN connector.

The connections are (in the sequence they appear physically on the
connector)

|===
|3|0V and equipment ground
|5|Opto isolated input positive
|2|Power supply positive (5 Volt, current limited)
|4|Opto isolated input negative
|1|0V and equipment ground (same as pin 3)
|===

The remote input can be used to receive an external signal on the opto
isolated inputs, or it can be wired to an external switch. To receive an
external signal wire the signal + to pin 5 and the signal – to pin 4.
When used as external optically isolated input the maximum continuous
voltage rating is 24V DC.

When wiring to an external switch links pins 4 and 1. Then connect the
external switch between pins 2 and 5.


=== Enabling the remote input in MagicQ

In the View Settings view in the Setup Window page down to the Port
Settings. Set up the remote trigger type and remote trigger action.

The remote trigger type can be set to NONE, MAKE, or BREAK, depending on
whether your external switch is a push to make or a push to break
switch. When using an external signal, setting the type to make will
cause a trigger when the voltage differential is positive.

The remote trigger action, determines what action is taken by MagicQ
when the remote input signal is detected. The options are:

* NONE
* CURRENT PLAYBACK GO
* CURRENT PLAYBACK FLASH
* ADD/SWAP
* SWAP
* DBO
* WING1 PB1 GO
* WING1 PB1 FLASH
* WING1 PB12 GO
* WING1 PB12 FLASH
* PB10 GO
* PB10 FLASH
* AUDIO BUMP
* TAP TO TIME

When set to NONE there is no special action associated with pressing the
remote input. However, the remote input can still be used in Cue Stacks
to trigger specific cues by setting the Halt Field in the Cue Stack to
REMOTE. The Cue will then wait till the remote trigger is detected
before starting to execute the Cue.

When set to SWAP, playbacks are set to SWAP mode whenever the remote
signal is detected – this can therefore be used with a foot-switch to
temporarily engage SWAP mode.

WING1 PB1 GO and WING1 PB1 FLASH are provided as an alternative to the
current playback GO and FLASH. This allows, for example, a smoke machine
to be set up on WING1 PB1 trigger by the remote input.

AUDIO BUMP allows the remote trigger to be used in the same way as when triggering from receiving audio.  Any Cue Stack set with "Audio Bumps Go" set will bump one step every time the remote input is triggered.

TAP TO TIME changes the speed of the currently selected playback.

In Setup, View System, View Status there is a counter of the number of
times the remote input has been switched since the system was started.
This enables MagicQ to be used to count the number of times an event has
occurred – e.g. customers pressing a button or starting a presentation
sequence.
