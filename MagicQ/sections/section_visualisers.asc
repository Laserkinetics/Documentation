== Using MagicQ with other Visualisers

In addition to its own free MagicVis visualiser, MagicQ supports connection with other Visualisers via network
protocols. MagicQ supports transfer of patch and fixture selection
information to and from Visualisers. The protocol used to communicate
between MagicQ and the Visualiser depends on the particular Visualiser.

The simplest way to connect is using the Art-Net protocol in the same way
as you would connect to Art-Net to DMX interfaces – most Visualisers now
support it. Art-Net does not support transfer of patch or fixture
selection information, so for this you will need to use a Visualiser
specific protocol.

It is possible to run MagicQ PC/Mac on the same system that is running the
Visualiser, however for best performance we suggest that you run them on separate PCs linked
via Ethernet.

=== Connecting to a Visauliser

To run both MagicQ PC and Visualiser on one PC set the option Setup, View Settings, Network, Send to Applications on this PC to Yes.

To run MagicQ PC and a Visualiser on two different systems then you need to ensure that both systems have their IP address and Subnet Address set up to be on the same network range - e.g. set one to 2.0.0.1 subnet 255.0.0.0 and the other to 2.0.0.2 subnet 255.0.0.0.

=== Capture

MagicQ supports connections to Capture visualiser
(www.capturesweden.com). 

There are two protocols for communication between MagicQ and Capture –
ArtNet and CITP. ArtNet is a standard protocol used to carry DMX over
Ethernet and enables control of the lighting.

CITP is an open protocol specific to Capture which enables both control
of lighting and the transfer of the show patch between MagicQ and
Capture. ChamSys provides executable files for both protocols.

To communicate using ArtNet simply set the required universes to Output
Type of ArtNet in Setup, View DMX I/O and enable the universes. To use
CITP simply set the Visualiser field for all required universes to
Capture.

==== Receiving Patch Data from Capture

It is possible for patch data to be transmitted from Capture to MagicQ
when connected via CITP protocol. Start a new show on MagicQ and then in
the Patch Window press the Visualiser Patch soft button. This will
download the Patch information from Capture to MagicQ. MagicQ uses a
fields in the personality to specify the Capture manufacturer name
(Make) and Capture moving light name).


=== WYSIWYG

MagicQ interfaces to the WYSIWYG visualiser using a special Wysiwyg
driver file. Download the MagicQ WYSIWYG driver file from ChamSys
download site and install it on the WYSIWYG PC.

==== Enabling MagicQ to output WYSIWYG data

Now you need to configure the outputs. Go to the Setup, View DMX I/O
window. You will see a list of the 64 universes and their current configuration.

Move to the Visualiser row and select WYSIWYG for the universes you wish to use.
There is no need to change the Status column to enabled - WYSIWYG is
automatically enabled when you select WYSIWYG as the visualiser.

If you are using WYWISYG on the same PC as MagicQ then set the
Visualiser to WYSIWYG (same PC) – otherwise, set it to WYSIWYG (remote).
When connecting to WYSIWYG using a MagicQ console, always use WYSIWYG (remote).

When using WYSIWYG and MagicQ on different PCs it is important to ensure
that MagicQ PC knows the IP address to use to communicate with WYSIWYG.

In Setup, View Settings, Network set the IP Address and Subnet Mask to be the same
as the IP address of your network port in use on your PC.

==== Running WYSIWYG

Start up WYSIWYG. 

In order to get WYSIWYG to respond to data received you need to set up
the ports in Device Manager. Select ChamSys MagicQ and then Connect.

Make sure you have installed the MagicQ WYSIWYG driver on the WYSIWYG
PC. MagicQ will not connect to WYSIWYG without it.

The universes in WYSIWYG must be bound to the ChamSys MagicQ device in
order for communication to occur with MagicQ.

==== Auto Patch

MagicQ supports the WYSIWYG Auto Patch protocol. Selecting Auto Patch on
WYSIWYG transfers the patch to MagicQ. To transfer a new show to MagicQ
first erase the show in MagicQ and then select Auto Patch, Send Patch in
WYSIWYG.

MagicQ identifies the fixtures in WYSIWYG and maps the names to the
MagicQ fixtures using a mapping table. If MagicQ can not identify a
fixture it will not be able to auto patch a fixture. The mapping between
MagicQ personality and WYSIWYG fixture is specified in the MagicQ
personality. Not all the different fixture modes are supported by both
WYSIWYG and MagicQ.

When performing an Auto Patch, MagicQ will report any fixtures that it
can not match. To fix a personality, edit the head in the Head Editor,
setting the correct WYSIWYG name. If the WYSIWYG name is empty then
pressing ENTER will fill in with the name received from WYSIWYG for the
last mismatch.


==== Auto Focus

MagicQ supports the WYSIWYG Auto Focus protocol. If you turn Auto Focus
on for the ChamSys port in the Device Manager on WYSIWYG then changes
made in WYSIWYG design mode will be relayed to the programmer in the
console.


==== Troubleshooting

Problem: WYSIWYG does not receive any data.

Solution: Check that you have installed the MagicQ WYSIWYG driver on the
WYSIWYG PC. Check that the connection is connected in WYSIWYG device
manager. Check that you have configured the correct MagicQ universes to
use WYSIWYG as their Vsualiser.

Problem: WYSIWYG will not connect on the same PC as MagicQ.

Solution: Check that you have configured the Visualiser to be WYSIWYG
(same PC) in the Setup Window.

Problem: WYSIWYG will not connect between two separate PCs.

Solution: Check that the network ports on the two PCs are configured to
the same IP subnet, that they are enabled, and that you have configured
MagicQ to use the correct network port (Setup, View Settings, IP
address).

Problem: WYSIWYG connects but no control of the lamps

Solution: Check the MagicQ Universe in WYSIWYG is bound to the MagicQ
device.


=== ESP Vision

ESP vision supports ArtNet control. Simply set the required universes to
Out Type of ArtNet and enable them. The Visualiser field should be set
to “None”.
