== Networking of MagicQ systems

It is possible to have many different MagicQ consoles on a single network – either to allow control of many different
fixtures, remote control or to provide master/slave configurations.  For the purposes of networking a MagicQ PC/Mac system connected to a MagicQ Wing can perform exactly the same function as a MagicQ console. 

MagicQ supports synchronisation (tracking) of playback between consoles
to enable one or more consoles to follow the playback state of the
master console.

MagicQ supports synchronising of show file data between consoles so that
one console on the network acts as a master console with the master show
file whilst slave consoles synchronise to that show data. Programming
changes can be made on any of the consoles with the show file on the
master being updated and then all other systems synchronised to the
master.

MagicQ enables multiple consoles to be used on a network and shows on
the separate consoles to be merged together and split up again. Zoning
of universes enables consoles to be working on different universes all
within the same network. MagicQ supports programming of a single show
file from multiple consoles. MagicQ does not currently support
programming by multiple users on a single console.

MagicQ supports automated copying of shows between consoles – for
example to automatically keep a slave console updated with the same show
that is running on the master console. This function can also be used as
an “archiving system” to enable a PC to automatically grab the shows
from the consoles on the network for back-up purposes.


=== Network addresses and host names

Each MagicQ console and MagicQ PC system should be configured with a
different IP address and a different host name. On MagicQ consoles the
IP address and host-name are set up in the Setup Window – on MagicQ PC
systems the IP address and host-name are set up in Windows.

For example, a typical MagicQ network might look like this:

==== Setting IP addresses on a PC

In Windows the way you set the IP address of your network connection
depends on the variant of Windows.  On newer systems click Startm Control Panel, Netwrok and Sharing, Change Adapter Settings.  On older systems click Start, Control Panel,
Network Connections. 

image:images/windowsnetwork.png[image]

This should show a list of network ports including any fixed network ports and wireless ports.  Right click the required network connection and select Properties.  Choose Internet Protocol (TCP/IP).

image:images/windowstcpip.png[image]

A dialog box should appear with the title Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)
properties.

image:images/windowstcpip2.png[image]

Choose "Use the following IP address". Enter the IP address (e.g. 2.0.0.10) and
the subnet mask (e.g. 255.0.0.0). The default gateway address can
generally be left blank. Click ok.


=== Checking IP addresses - Ping Test

MagicQ includes a ping test for resolving network problems. At the
command line type ping followed by the IP address, e.g. to test network
connection to IP address 2.0.0.3

ping 2.0.0.3

There is a short cut for use on the console keypad - enter three dots
and then the IP address (no space)

pass:[…2.0.0.3]

Entering just ... will ping the last tried IP address.


=== Checking consoles on the network

It is possible to check which MagicQ consoles are on the network by going
to Setup, View System, View Status and selecting the Network tab.

=== Grabbing shows from other consoles

It is possible to grab a show that is running on another console onto
the current console. Press the Grab Show soft button in the View DMX I/O
view of the Setup Window. Choose which console you wish to grab a show
from. The show is copied from the other console to the show folder on
this console, and the show is loaded into memory.

Grabbing shows from other consoles requires “Enable remote access” in
the Setup, View Settings, Network Settings to be enabled on the consoles
you are grabbing the show from.


=== Zoning

MagicQ supports Zones for controlling multiple rooms / areas in a venue.
In Setup, View DMX/IO each Universe can be allocated to a Zone, and then all the Universes in
a Zone can be controlled together – e.g. for enabling / disabling of a
Zone.

Special items in the Execute Window to enable easy control of zones,
including enabling and disabling zones and setting and clearing hot
takeover in a zone. This allows complete control of a multi-room system
directly from the Execute Window without users needing to access the
Setup Window.

=== Setting up Network Sessions

Software version 1.5.9.4 has made the configuration of multiple MagicQ
consoles in a network by the introduction of the concept of Network
Sessions:

* A MagicQ console is made part of a network session by simply setting
the Net Session Mode and choosing a Net Session ID (0 is the default
session).

* Within a network session only one MagicQ console is the Master, all
others are Slaves to the Master console. Only the Master console outputs
universes (ArtNet/ACN/Pathport) on the network. All universes that have
patched heads and are set to an Output type of ArtNet, ACN or Pathport
are controlled.

* It is possible at any time to change which console is the Master
console by using the Take Control feature from the Slave console.

* The Net Session Mode can be set to “Sync Auto Takeover” or “Sync
Manual Takeover” – when set to “Sync Auto Takeover” if the Master
console fails then a Slave will automatically take over. In “Sync Manual
Takeover” the user must manually use Take Control.


Within a network session

* All Slaves are automatically synchronised to the show file from the Master console.

* All Slaves can take control of part of the output via the selective channel control feature.

* All Slaves can edit show data including Palettes, Cues and Cue Stacks on the Master console.

* All Slaves are automatically synchronised to the playback state of the Master console. Each Slave can choose to
Inhibit PB Sync, for example whilst programming.

It is possible to inhibit all network output from the consoles in the
network session using the Inhibit All feature. All consoles outputs
within the network session are disabled. It is still possible to change
Master but the outputs remain disabled.

When the Network Session Mode is enabled (set to Manual Takeover or
Automatic Takeover) then it is not necessary to set up any other
settings relating to Hot Takeover, Playback Sync Type, Playback Sync IP, Playback Sync Port,
Show Data Sync Type or Show Data Sync – MagicQ sets this
automatically within the network session.

Just set Net Session Mode and Net Session ID for all the consoles you
wish to be part of the session.


==== Manual Takeover

image:images/multiconsolemanualtakeover.png[image]

The first console to start becomes the Master. In Setup, View DMX I/O,
Take Control and Release Control can be used to swap which console is
the Master at any time.


==== Auto Takeover

image:images/multiconsoleautotakeover.png[image]

The first console to start becomes the Master. In Setup, View DMX I/O,
Take Control and Release Control can be used to swap which console is
the Master at any time.

If the Master console stops for any reason then one of the Slave
consoles will take over.

The Hot Takeover Fade Type can be set to Manual or Automatic. When set
to Manual the operator has output is frozen until the
operator decides what new look to change to. 

When set to Automatic, a gradual fade is made to the look set on the Playbacks – in this mode an operator
will often put up a “safe” state on the standby console which can be
used if the main console has a problem.

With manual fade type when MagicQ determines that it should take over a
universe it will load a snapshot of the last data from that universe
into its Programmer. The universe will be completely controlled
from within the Programmer and not from the Playbacks. The operator can
then set up the playbacks as they wish and then clear the programmer to
change to this new look. Clearing the programmer with time enables the
operator to specify a fade time to the new look.

With automatic fade type, MagicQ loads the snapshot of the last data from that
universe into the Programmer and then automatically clears the
programmer using the hot-takeover fade time.

Since both options use the programmer, it is recommended that the
programmer is kept clear on the standby console.


==== Inhibit Outputs

It is possible to inhibit all the outputs within the network session so
that none of the consoles within the network session output onto the
network – for example if a “guest” console is in use.

In Setup, View DMX I/O press the INHIBIT OUTPUTS soft button. Outputs
will continue to be inhibited even if the Master console changes. When
UNINHIBIT OUTPUTS soft button is pressed the Master Console within the
network session will resume outputiing.


=== Multi Console Programming

Within a network session MagicQ supports programming of one show from multiple MagicQ consoles /
MagicQ PC systems on the network.

image:images/networkingmultiprog.png[image]

Multi programming enables multiple consoles to access one show file held
on the master console with all consoles being able to make changes to
that show file. MagicQ ensures that the slave consoles are synchronised
to the master console show data. Updates from any console are
synchronised across the network.

When synchronised the consoles have the same show data, however
they still operate as separate consoles with a separate programmer.

Recording and updating of Groups, Palettes, FX, Cues, Cue Stacks,
Macros, and Grids will be synchronised between the consoles. Note
however that changes to the Patch must be made on the master console and
they will clear any programmer information on the slave consoles.


==== Checking Slave synchronisation

The status of the slave synchronisation is shown in the status bar.
Initially the status window will show “NoCon”.

image:images/multiprognocon.png[image]

Once the Slave has a connection to the Master over the network
(but not yet synchronised) it will show “NoSync”.

image:images/multiprognosync.png[image]

Once synchronised it will show “Sync”:

image:images/multiprogsync.png[image]

It is possible to force a show slave to resynchronise by holding the
left and right cursor keys and pressing SET. It is also possible to
resync by restarting or soft resetting the show slave console.


=== Selective Channel Control

Selective channel control enables Slave consoles to select and
control different channels on the master consoles outputs. This allows
any console on the network to take control of a set of channels in the
lighting rig.

With selective channel control the slave consoles send their output data
to the show master and then the show master merges the data from all the
slaves onto its outputs.

image:images/multiprogcontrol.png[image]


==== Selecting which console controls which channels

MagicQ enables several different ways of selecting which channels are
controlled from which console on the network – selected channels, active channels, groups of channels,
universes and zones. MagicQ defaults to the show master having control
of all the channels.

Slaves request control of channels using the Setup, View DMX I/O, Multi
Prog Select soft button.

image:images/multiprogcontroloptions.png[image]

|==============
|None|The Slave does not control any channels.
|One Head|The Slave controls the first selected head only. If Next Head
is used to sub select heads then the first sub selected head is
controlled.
|Selected|The Slave controls the currently selected heads. When no heads
are selected, none are controlled.
|Active|The Slave controls all channels that are active in the
programmer.
|Last Active|The Master and Slave both control channels – the last
one to change a channel in the programmer controls the channel.
|Group|The Slave controls the group that was selected when this option
was chosen.
|Zones|The Slave controls selected zones (as set up in DMX I/O)
|Universes|The Slave controls selected universes
|All|The Slave controls all channels
|==============

When multiple slaves are in use then different slaves can control
different channels on the lighting rig. If the same channel is requested by
multiple slaves then the latest selection will take precedence. The show
slave shows the multiple control method in the status bar – e.g. for
selected heads it shows “CC-Sel”.

image:images/multiprogccsel.png[image]

When the slave has no channels under control it shows “CC-None”.

image:images/multiprogccnone.png[image]

At any time the Master can take control of all channels using the Setup,
View DMX I/O, Multi Prog Select soft button. When the Master is
controlling all channels then it shows “MCC” in the status bar. When
some channels are under control by a slave console then it shows “SCC”.

image:images/multiprogmcc.png[image]

=== Inter Console Messaging

It is possible to trigger message boxes from Cues in a Cue Stack. Simply
add a comment field to the Cue in the Cue Stack starting with a !. When
this Cue executes the message box will be shown.

In Setup, View Settings, View Windows there is a new option, Message
Window. This specifies where the message box is shown (main screen,
external screen 1, external screen 2) and whether a network message is
sent to other consoles.

Setting “Net Only” results in messages only being sent over the network,
not shown on the console where the Cue executed.

By default the message box shows immediately for 5 seconds and then
closes. The delay before the message box shows and the time it stays
visible can be set using parameters inbetween the !.

!<delay>,<show length>!

!10!Hello World // Delay for 10 seconds before showing message

!10,20!Hello World // Delay for 10 seconds and show message box for 20
seconds

!0,0!Hello World // Show message and do not close message box

If the comment starts with a !! instead of a ! then the console does an
alert as well as showing the message. The alert flashes the main screen
intensity and the console lamps to try to get the operators attention.

Messages can be sent directly from the keyboard by entering text
starting with a ! or a !!.
