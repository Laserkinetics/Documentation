== Quick Start
=== Starting up MagicQ

On MagicQ consoles hold the power button on the rear panel.  On MagicQ PC and Mac click on the MagicQ application icon.

On start up you are presented with an option to load demo shows or to continue the last show.  Selecting last show will load and run the last show used on the system.  This option can be hidden for subsequent start ups.

The console remembers all windows that were open when the console was
last used. To close all windows press SHIFT and CLOSE.

Press SETUP to open the Setup Window.

=== Calibrating the Touch Screen

On MagicQ consoles if the touch screen does not seem to be responding to your touch
correctly then you may need to calibrate the touch screen.

Press the SETUP button to open the Setup Window. Press the CAL TOUCH
soft button. When asked for confirmation press 1 on the keypad or press
the CAL TOUCH soft button again.

Calibration works by finding the bottom left and top right corners of
the screen. First press the bottom left of the touch screen and then the
top right. You may wish to use a fine but blunt object.

The shortcut CTRL + SET can be used to open the Calibrate window at any
time.


=== Starting a New Show

image:images/newshowmode.png[image]

To start a new show, go to the Setup Window and press the NEW SHOW soft
button. This will clear the current show from memory – shows that have
been previously saved to disc will not be affected. You will be asked to
confirm by selecting YES.

There is a choice of four modes.

* Normal - faders activate Cue Stacks. When recording, all data in the
programmer is stored in recorded cues
* Theatre non-track - faders operate levels only. When recording, all
data in the programmer is stored in recorded cues
* Theatre tracking - faders operate levels only. When recording only
data in the programmer that has changed since the last record is stored
in recorded cues
* Hog II warp – like Theatre Tracking but with some extra features to
make the programming more familiar to Hog II users.

In Theatre modes, fixtures return to their default values when under
control of a playback or the programmer. The keypad is set up to enable
selection of Palettes using Palette numbers, and Cue Stack timing
defaults to being stepped timing rather than chase timing.

The mode can be changed at any time by using the Programming Mode soft
button in the Setup Window. In addition each individual option / default
value can be customised by the user and saved as their personal settings
file.

Starting a show clears all patching, all programming and all palettes.
It does not clear console specific options such as the configuration of
the DMX outputs or the calibration of the touch screen.

=== Enabling Outputs

image:images/setupdmxio.png[image]

To enable output of channel data select the DMX IO VIEW in the Setup
Window. This windows enables modification of the inputs and outputs for
all the universes. MagicQ consoles support DMX directly from the
console or via an external Ethernet to DMX convertor.  On MagicQ PC or Mac you can output via USB to DMX interfaces (such as MagicDMX) or via DMX outputs from the Wings.

==== Using Direct DMX Outputs

All current MagicQ consoles have DMX output ports directly on the rear
panel.

The four DMX outputs on the rear panel automatically output universes 1
to 4 unless they are configured otherwise. The DMX will be output
regardless of the “Status” enabled or disabled in the Setup DMX I/O window. On
Pro consoles there is a green LED on the rear panel that indicates when
DMX is being output.

If you wish to choose alternative universes to be output to the four DMX
outputs on the rear panel then you will need to configure the outputs
manually. For each of the Universes you wish to output on the rear
panel, select Out Type as “MagicQ Direct” and Port 1, Port 2, Port 3 and
Port 4 and enable the universes.

The picture below shows the direct ports to output Universes 5 to 8.

image:images/setupdmxiomanual.png[image]


==== Using Outputs via network

MagicQ supports output via the network ports using Art-Net, Pathport or ACN Streaming DMX.

To output Art-Net on a Universe enable it and ensure that the output type
is set to Art-Net. Choose which Art-Net Universe you wish to Output the
MagicQ Universe on. MagicQ defaults to outputing MagicQ universe 1 on
the first Art-Net Universe (Art 0-0).

If you are using Ethernet to DMX512 conversion boxes then you will need
to configure the boxes to respond to the correct Art-Net sub-net and
Art-Net universe. 

With ChamSys SnakeSys B4 or R4 you need to set up the two rotary switches to the correct values – the left one for Art-Net sub-net
and the right one for Art-Net universe. The interface will then decode
the four Art-Net universes starting from that Art-Net subnet and universe.

In most networks the Art-Net sub-net is set to 0. If you
are using only one Ethernet to DMX512 interface then you can normally
use subnet 0 universe 0.

If you are using multiple Ethernet Interfaces then you will need to set
each Ethernet Interface to a different Art-Net Universe – for example
when using two ChamSys SnakeSys B4 Interfaces set the first Interface to
Art-Net Universe 0 and the second one to Art-Net Universe 4.

MagicQ includes a DMX viewer for monitoring Art-Net on the Network –
select Tools, DMX View.


=== Connecting a MagicQ Playback Wing

To connect a MagicQ Playback or Extra Wing simply connect the Wing to the MagicQ
console via USB. In the Setup Window, View System, View Wings set the
first Wing to be type USB Wing.

By default the Playback Wings are set so that the Wings change page when
the Next Page / Prev Page button are pressed on the MagicQ console. It
is possible to make the Wings operate completely independently of the
main MagicQ console by changing the “Lower Bank Tie” and “Upper Bank
Tie”.

To use multiple Playback Wings simply connect them and change the type
to USB wing.


==== Setting Playback Wing IDs

When using MagicQ consoles with multiple Playback / Extra Wings (or
multiple Execute Wings) it is now possible to set a Wing ID for each
Wing. The required wing ID can then be set in Setup, View Wings to
ensure that the Wings are identified correctly and control the correct
Playbacks. Previously Wings could swap over if one was reset or they
were powered on in a different sequence.

Note that the Wing ID is only supported on new Wings with blue LCDs and
the most recent Wing firmware). The Wing ID is set by holding the reset
button under the armrest of the Wing whilst holding the lower most Page
UP and Page Down buttons.


=== Connecting External Monitors

MagicQ consoles have VGA connectors on the rear panel for connecting external
monitors. These monitors can be touch screen monitors.

image:images/setupmonitors.png[image]

==== Pro 2010 and Pro 2014 Operating System

On MagicQ consoles running the Pro 2010 there is support for two external
monitors with resolution up to 1440x900. The Pro 2014 supports two
external monitors up to 1920x1080 resolution.

These monitors can be touch screens (only External 1 on Pro 2010).  MagicQ supports a number of <<_touch_screen_protocols,touch screen protocols>>

External monitors must be powered and connected when the console powers up in order to be detected
correctly.

Set the required resolution in the Resolution column and enable it.

When using USB touch screens, go to Setup, View System, View Monitors to
see the status of the connected touch screens.


==== Pro Operating System

From MagicQ version 1.5.9.4 there is no longer support for an external
monitor on the original Pro systems since the graphics card is not
capable of handling the resolutions of modern monitors. Full external
monitor support can be obtained by upgrading the hardware to Pro 2014.


=== Patching

Open the Patch Window by pressing the PATCH button. The Patch Window has
three views, VIEW HEADS, VIEW CHANS and VIEW DMX. In this section we
describe patching in VIEW HEADS.

image:images/patchsoftbuttons.png[image]

Choose the head you wish to patch by pressing the CHOOSE HEAD soft
button. The Window will change to give you a list of manufacturers and
heads. Select a head by pressing the touch screen. Alternatively scroll
around the Window using the cursor keys, and press ENTER when the cursor
is over the correct head.

image:images/chooseheadmanufacturer.png[image]

Once you have chosen a head you will be returned to the Patch Window.
Press the PATCH IT soft button to patch the head. You will be prompted
for the number you wish to prompt and the address where you wish to
patch the heads. Use @ to patch at a specific address.

image:images/patchit.png[image]

For example to patch 5 Mac250 mode 4 to Universe 2 channel 1 enter

5 @ 2 - 1

If you wish to patch multiple channels at fixed offsets e.g. five Martin
Mac250s at DMX channels 1,21,41,61,81 then enter

5 @ 2 – 1 / 20

image:images/patchmac500s.png[image]

To patch a dimmer, simply press CHOOSE DIM/MEDIA, select Generic
Dimmerer and then patch one or more dimmers as above.

In the Patch Window all the lighter coloured fields can be configured.
To modify a field, first move the cursor to the field, then input the
new value using the keypad and keyboard, and finally press ENTER.

In this way you can modify DMX address, head number, head name and gel
for each of your patched heads.


==== Naming and Numbering Heads

Once you have patched all the heads you can then name and number them as
you wish. It is recommended that you name the dimmer or the head based
on its location (e.g. front wash / back truss SL). For dimmers you may
wish to configure the gel. This makes programming easier – enabling the
console to auto program cues for you.

image:images/patchdimmers.png[image]

The gel field uses gel numbers. For Lee colours enter the gel number
directly (e.g. 181 for Lee 181). For Rosco colours enter the gel number
preceded by dot (e.g. .14 for Rosco 14). For no colour enter 0. If you
would prefer to use colour names rather than gel numbers then simply
enter the colour name.

To test a patched head or dimmer, simply press the TEST MODE soft button
(soft button encode C) and the head which the cursor is over will be
tested. For heads it locates the fixture; for dimmers it sets the dimmer
to 100%. Press the TEST MODE soft button again to turn test mode off.


=== Controlling Heads

==== Selecting Heads

In order to control intelligent heads it is necessary to be able to
select which heads to use. The MagicQ console keeps track of the
currently selected heads to enable it to determine which heads to apply
changes to. The operator can select head individually or can use groups
to recall configurations of heads that are used frequently.

In “Hog Warp” mode or when the Setup option “Keypad always selects head
is set” you can select heads from the keypad – for instance to select
heads 1 through 4.

1 THRU 4 ENTER

In other modes, you can select the heads using

1 THRU 4 @@


==== Selecting heads from the Group/Heads Window

The console automatically generates a group for all the heads of a
particular head type. In addition new groups can easily be recorded.

The Group Window has two views. VIEW GROUPS enables selection of heads
using groups whilst VIEW HEADS enables individual selection of heads.

In VIEW GROUPS, pressing the touch screen for a particular group selects
all the heads associated with that group. All other heads are
deselected. To select multiple groups, press SHIFT and a group to toggle
the group in and out of selection.

In VIEW HEADS, individual heads are selected / deselected by pressing
the touch screen. Use PG UP and PG DN to scroll through the heads.


==== Recording a Group

Select the heads you want in a group using keypad selection or in the
VIEW HEADS view of the Group Window.

Change to the VIEW GROUPS view.

Press RECORD and then select the group you wish to record either by
pressing the touch screen or by using the cursor keys and then pressing
ENTER.


=== Naming a Group

When recording a group, if you key in a name before pressing the touch
screen (or pressing ENTER) then the group will be named at the same time
as it is recorded.

You can name a group at any time by keying in the name, pressing SET,
and pressing the touch screen.

If you do not have a keyboard then press SET and select the group to
name by pressing the touch screen (or using cursor keys and ENTER). A
keyboard window will be displayed for you to enter the name on screen.


=== Recalling a Group

Once a group has been recorded then pressing the touch screen for the
group will make all the heads in the group selected. All other heads
will be deselected. Use SHIFT to select multiple groups. There is a
Setup option to allow the user to default to selecting multiple groups.



=== Setting Levels for Dimmers

From the keypad you can enter commands such as

1 @ 50 ENTER

1 THRU 4 @ FULL ENTER

It is also possible to use the Intensity Window by pressing the INT
button. This window displays a fader for each dimmer and head patched
onto the console. Pressing the slider part of the fader sets the
appropriate level. When a fader is moved from 0 the channel in the
programmer is activated – and the fader will turn red.

The Window has two views, View Prog and View Preset – faders changed in
the Prog View affect the intensity levels in the programmer and are
recorded into Cues. Faders changed in the Preset View are like
traditional “one per channel” preset faders on older lighting consoles –
this enables levels on channels to be set without affecting programming.
This is equivalent to “Parking” on other consoles.

The SQUARE OFF soft button enables fast programming of intensities.
Using the touch panel select the channels you wish to have at full and
at zero – but don’t bother being exactly accurate with the level of the
selection. Pressing SQUARE OFF finishes the job by setting all channels
that are less than 50% to 0 whilst setting channels above 50% to full.

Use the ALL TO FULL and ALL TO ZERO buttons to change the level of all
the channels.

Press the CLEAR soft button to clear the programmer.

image:images/intensitywindow.png[image]


=== Locating Heads

The first action you are likely to want to do is to locate the heads –
i.e. to put them into a starting position. Select the required heads and
then press the LOCATE button. Locating a head brings all the attributes
for that head into the programmer.

If the heads enable DMX control of the striking of the lamp then you may
need to “Lamp On” the head in order to see the beam. Select the heads
and then press SHIFT LOCATE. This runs the "Lamp On" macro.


=== Modifying Attributes

Intelligent heads have several different attributes typically including
pan and tilt, colour, gobo and iris. When the MagicQ lighting console
patches an intelligent head it maps the head parameters to standard
attributes to enable easy access of the features of the head.

Attributes are categorised into four types – Intensity, Position, Colour
and Beam. On MagicQ there is a window for each of these attribute types.
Select the required heads, then open the required window.

image:images/layouts.png[image]

You can quickly open all the Palette Windows by pressing Layout 1 or holding CTRL and pressing
the top soft button marked Palettes – this opens the windows in the
layout below.

image:images/paletteswindows.png[image]

The highlighted window enables controls the soft buttons and rotary
encoders. In each of the Windows the X and Y encoders control the most
important attributes – Pan and Tilt in Position Window, Col Wheel 1 and
Col Wheel 2 in the Colour Window and Gobo Wheel 1 and Gobo Wheel 2 in
the Beam Window. In the Beam Window there are more than eight attributes
to be controlled – these are accessed using multiple pages of encoders –
by pressing the NEXT PAGE soft button.

image:images/beamwindow.png[image]

For indexed attributes such as colour wheels and gobo wheels, the button
associated with each encoder can be used to bump the attribute value to
the next range. Pressing SHIFT and the button bumps back to the previous
range.

In addition the window enables selection of palette values for the
attribute type using the touch screen. When heads are recorded the
system automatically generates palettes for each attribute type. You can
record new palette entries, or modify existing ones as you see fit.

image:images/colwindow.png[image]

In the Colour Window pressing the COL MIX / COL ATTRIBS button changes
to the colour picker. Press COL TYPE to select standard colours, Lee
colours, Rosco colours or HIS model.

image:images/colmix.png[image]


=== Recording a Palette

To record a favourite combination of attributes into a palette (e.g. a
rotating triangle with a prism on a MAC500), first modify the attributes
to the values you wish to record. Then press RECORD and select the
palette entry you wish to record. By default only selected heads get
recorded into a palette (this can be changed by pressing SHIFT + RECORD
and choosing Record options).

image:images/recordsoftbuttons.png[image]

To name the palette, key in the name on the external keyboard, then
press SET and select the palette entry you wish to name. To use the on
screen keyboard, first move the cursor over the palette entry, then
press SET and key in the name followed by ENTER.


=== Adding in FX

To add a FX to some heads, select the heads then from the Group Window
or the Prog Window press the ADD FX soft button. Choose the FX to add.

Once you have chosen a FX you are returned to the Prog Window. Use the
encoders to modify the parameters of the FX such as the speed, size and
spread between heads.

You can add multiple FX to a head, provided that the FX uses different
attributes - e.g. you can mix a Pan Sine with a Tilt Sine.


=== Recording a Cue

To record a look onto a Cue, first set up the look, then press RECORD
and press the S button of the Playback to record the Cue onto.

To test the Cue, first clear the programmer by pressing CLEAR then raise
the Playback fader or press the Playback flash button.

Note that recording a Cue onto a Playback, generates a Cue Stack with a
single Cue. However, as there is only one step, it behaves as though it
is just the Cue on the Playback.

To view a recorded Cue, press the S button for the Playback, and
then press CUE to open the Cue Window.

To configure options when recording, press SHIFT + RECORD and a toolbar
of record options will be displayed. Choose the options you require then
press the S button of the Playback as above.

image:images/recordoptions.png[image]

=== Recording a Cue Stack (Chase or Theatre Stack)

Recording a Cue Stack is the same as recording a Cue - you simply record
multiple Cues onto a Playback and you end up with a Cue Stack.

So, for example to record a stack of two looks, the first yellow dots,
the second blue triangles:

* Generate the yellow dots look.
* Press RECORD and press the S button of the playback.
* Generate the blue triangles look.
* Press RECORD and press the S button of the playback.

To test the Cue, clear the programmer by pressing CLEAR then raise the
Playback fader or press the Playback flash button.

View the Cue Stack by selecting the Playback and pressing CUE STACK to
open the Cue Stack Window.

When you record more than one Cue onto a Playback the Cue Stack controls
the transition from one Cue to another. In Normal mode by default the
Cue Stack operates like a chase - i.e. each Cue is executed in turn,
with timing being handled by a Chase Speed for the whole Cue Stack.

image:images/cuestackchase.png[image]

In Theatre Modes the default timing is Cue Timing – individual Fade times
on each step with GO stepping from one step to the next.

image:images/cuestacktheatre.png[image]

The timing mode can be changed, so that the Cues play back in a theatre
style using the GO / STOP buttons. Select the VIEW OPTIONS view and
press the CUE TIMING and CHASE TIMING soft buttons to modify the timing
mode.

image:images/cuestackindividualtiming.png[image]

=== Selecting and recording complete window layouts

The console enables complete window layouts to be recorded and selected.
The console incorporates several standard window layouts including
Palettes and Cue Stacks.

There are physical buttons for Layout 1, 2 and 3.  Layouts 1 to 12 can also be accessed by holding CTRL and selecting one of the top soft buttons.

To select a Window layout press one of the Layout buttons, or hold down CTRL and select one of the top soft
buttons.

To record a Window layout first close all windows (SHIFT + CLOSE). Then
open the required Windows and size them appropriately. Press RECORD and
then press a Layout button or hold down CTRL and select one of the top soft buttons.

To name the Window layout, press SET and then press a Layout button or hold down CTRL and select
one of the top soft buttons. Enter a name for the layout.


=== Saving the Show

When programming a show the show is stored in memory. In order to store your show on the disk you need to press the
SAVE SHOW soft button in the Setup Window.

Whilst programming, you should regularly save your show, so that if the
power fails your show data is not lost. You can chose any filename - MagicQ will automatically set the file
extension to .shw.

By default, MagicQ periodically saves a backup of your show to
disk. It uses the same show name but with the file extension .sbk.

It is a good idea to save your show to different file names so that you
have various points you can back-track to if things go wrong. For
example, save the show as myshow-patch.shw after you have patched and
then as myshow-final.shw after you have finished programming.

When you shut down MagicQ through the QUIT soft button in the Setup
Window, MagicQ automatically saves a backup copy of your show with
a .sbk extension. When you subsequently restart MagicQ this file
will be re-loaded. This ensures that MagicQ starts up as it was
when the QUIT soft button was pressed.

MagicQ show files are typically only a few megabytes in size so many different shows or versions of a show can be saved without problem.

=== Playback

Now you have Cues and Cue Stacks recorded you can play back your show
using the Playback faders and buttons. You can control how each Cue
Stack is played back using the Cue Stack options – for example you can
set the fader to control LTP fades or FX size and speed.

Make sure the master faders are raised!

Note that if you have a large show file you may wish to turn auto
backups off during playback. Remember to turn them back on when you are
programming.

If you get stuck at any point, just press the HELP button!
