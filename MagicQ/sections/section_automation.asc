== Automation

=== MagicQ Automation Window

MagicQ supports an automation system to enable it to automatically
respond to both external, internal and timed events. MagicQ can trigger
on external events such as MIDI notes, DMX input, serial input,
timecode, and the remote contact input. MagicQ can also trigger on
internal events such as system startup, system shutdown and system
powerfail. In addition MagicQ can trigger on timed (scheduled) events.

MagicQ supports an Automation Window for managing all of the automated
events. The Automation Window supports multiple events with each event
being subject to specified parameters.

Each event then triggers a particular MagicQ function – this can be a
function on a Playback, a Cue Stack, a Cue, a Page, a Macro or a Layout.

MagicQ can take a parameter from the event trigger and pass it to the
function – for example, it could take the velocity from a MIDI note
event and tigger a Playback level using that velocity.

==== Autom Events

Each event can have up to 3 paramters (P1,P2,P3) to filter the event
further.

|====

==== Autom Functions

Each Function can have up to 3 function parameters F1, F2, F3. For
Playback (PB) functions, F1 is the Playback number. For Stack functions,
F1 is the Stack number. For Cue functions F1 is the Cue number.

For Page functions F1 is the Page Number and F2 specifies a Playback to
be activated on the Page Change (0 = none) and a Cue Id to jump to on PB
go and PB jump.

* PB a,r,level
* PB level
* PB activate
* PB release
* PB act FULL
* PB go
* PB back
* PB ffwd
* PB fbck
* PB jump
* Stack toggle
* Stack activate
* Stack release
* Stack level
* Cue toggle
* Cue activate
* Cue release
* Cue level
* Run macro
* Change layout
* Change page
* Change page release main
* Change page release all

==== MIDI events

If you add MIDI events then these override the miditable.txt file – the
file is completely ignored.

==== Serial Port events

If you add serial port events then these override the normal ChamSys
serial remote protocol functions. The serial port settings in Setup,
View Settings, Ports must be set up with Serial Remote Protocol set to
ChamSys RX.

MagicQ matches the serial data received to the string you specify in the
P2 field using the same format as in the Cue Stack Macros but without
the X. So if you set the P2 field in the Autom to

1,2,3 it will match the serial data received 1,2,3

P1 is the number of characters to match and P3 determines which
character is passed onto the Autom function.

So if you want to set up MagicQ to respond to serial commands to set the
level of Playback 1 using the serial commands “L1” to “L100” you would
set up the Autom as:

Type Serial Port

P1 1 // Match 1 character

P2 “L” // Character to match

P3 2 // 2^nd^ character of received string

Function PB Level

F1 1


=== Scheduled Events

MagicQ supports timed events for trigger Cues at specific times of the day or
days of the week. Any Cue in a Cue Stack can be set to trigger based on
a scheduled event rather than following on from the previous Cue. This
enables time of day and date based events to be run automatically.

Scheduled events are supported on MagicQ consoles and on MagicQ PC when
connected to a MagicQ Wing.

19/30/5 for 19 hours 30 minutes and 5 seconds

or

*/10/0 to have the event occur every hour at 10 minutes past the hour

or

*/*/0 for every minute

The date


==== Dates and days of the week

It is also possible to set dates. For example to have an event on the
24 December 2005 enter:

24/12/2005

You can also specify particular days of the week using the characters A
to G where A is Monday, B is Tuesday, C is Wednesday etc…

So for an event every Monday and Tuesday enter:

AB

For an event on the first day of every month enter

1


==== Sunrise + Sunset (astronomical)

MagicQ has the capability to trigger events based on the sunrise and
sunset at the particular location.

In order for sunrise and sunset events to occur correctly MagicQ must be
configured with the correct longitude, latitude and time zones. These
parameters are configured in Setup, View Settings, Mode. The sunrise and
sunset times for the current location can be checked in Setup, View
System, View Status.

To set a scheduled event based on sunrise or sunset first set the time starting with
R for sunrise or S for sunset.

It is possible to set offsets on the sunrise and sunset times so the
event is triggered a certain time before or after the sunrise or sunset.

For example to trigger 20 minutes after sunrise enter

R+0/20/0

To trigger 30 minutes before sunset enter

S-0/30/0



=== Automated Start of Playbacks / Executes

MagicQ includes several options for automated start of Playbacks and
Executes. These options are available on MagicQ consoles and on MagicQ
PC systems when connected to a MagicQ USB Wing or Interface. See Setup,
View Settings, Playback, Activate Playbacks On Start.

=== Keyboard macros

Keyboard macros enable you to record sequences of key presses and to
replay the sequence at the press of a single button. Keyboard macros can
be assigned to any button on the console (including to a SHIFT+button
and CTRL+button) or to buttons on an external keyboard. The first 10
keyboard macros are available on the Quick Macro Tool Bar.

To record a keyboard macro, go to the Macro Window, press RECORD and
select a macro to record. The console then records all of the following
key sequences until you press the Macro Window button and the "End
Macro" soft button.

To assign a macro to a button, press the "Assign Macro" soft button and
press a key to assign it to (e.g. one of the 6 spare keys). Keyboard
macros can also be assigned to a combination of keys – for example if
you hold one key and press another key. Keyboard macros are saved into
show files and also when you Save Settings, so that it is possible to
personalise your console.

If you accidentally assign a keyboard macro to the wrong button then you
can easily change the assignment. Open the Macro Window, move the cursor
to the macro you want to change the assignment for and press the “Assign
Macro” button. Now press the button that really wanted to assign it to.

A macro assignment to a button can be removed using the “De-assign
Macro” soft button.

You can view the data in each step of a Macro in the View Data view in
the Macro window.

Macro steps can be deleted using the REMOVE key. Note when a button is
pressed there is a “press” and a “release” – both should be removed –
otherwise the button state will become confused.

It is possible to move steps in the Macro, View Data view – press MOVE
and then select the source followed by the destination. Multiple steps
can be moved using SHIFT and the cursor keys.

The macro data can be reordered if the times have been changed out of
sequence using the REORDER soft button.

Macros can be inhibited from the Setup Window using the “Inhibit Macros”
option.


==== Quick Macro Toolbar

The Quick Macro Tool Bar is accessed by pressing the screen in the
Status Display (the area of the screen above Playbacks PB1 to PB5 with
the Clock). The Macro Tool Bar can be closed by pressing in the Status
Display again.

The Macro Tool Bar shows the Key Macros 1 to 10.


==== Keyboard Macro Timing

Playback of keyboard macros can use the times that the macro was
recorded with or using external time code sources. By default macros are
played back using “Immediate” timing. Use the SET TIMING soft button to
change the timing to “Real time” or “Time code”.

The timing type can be changed after the macro has been recorded –
however if external time code timing is required then this should be
selected before the macro is recorded. This enables the console to
record the key and button presses according to the received time code
signal.

Times can be modified in the View Data view of the Macro Window using
the keypad and Encoder E. Multiple items in the macro can be changed at
one time using SHIFT and the cursor keys to select the items.

When using time code timing, the + and – operators can be used to offset
the timing of a sequence of items.


==== Recording Playback faders

Macros support fader moves and encoder changes as well as button
presses. This enables complete recording and playback of macro segments.
Macro timing and playback uses a high resolution internal clock enabling
accurate playback of recorded sequences.

MagicQ optimises fader moves to remove redundant steps.


==== In built Macros

MagicQ supports a number of in-built macros which carry out common
programming key sequences including quite a few that would normally
require multiple key presses or simulataneous pressing of more than one
key. The In-built Macros can be useful on touch systems where it is not
possible to touch 2 keys at one time.

Press the In built Macro soft button and choose the macro to assign to
the current item in the Macro Window.

==== Scheduled events in Cue Stacks

Cue Stacks can be used to program a list of scheduled events.  To use this feature, set the Halt field of each of the Cues in the Cue Stack Window to
“Sched”. Double click to change the field. Then enter the time in the Wait field.  The times can have wildcards and sunrise/sunset times as per <<_Scheduled_Events,Autom>> events.


If dates are required then they are entered into the macro field starting with Z and ending with Z. For example to have an event on the

24 December 2005 enter:

Z24/12/2005Z

You can also specify particular days of the week using the characters A
to G where A is Monday, B is Tuesday, C is Wednesday etc…

So for an event every Monday and Tuesday enter:

ZABZ

For an event on the first day of every month enter

Z1Z
