== Blind Visualisation
MagicQ supports Blind Visualisation and Preview Visualisation when used
together with MagicVis, Capture or WYSIWYG. This enables a Visualiser to
show the contents of the Programmer during BLIND mode or to preview a
Playback that is not active on the real outputs.

In Patch, View Vis press the VIS SOURCE Soft button to choose between
visualising the console Output, the BLIND programmer, the selected
Playback, or the next step on the selected Playback.

When set to “Blind Programmer” MagicQ will add the contents of the
Programmer to the Output visualisation even when the programmer is in
BLIND mode.

When set to “Playback” MagicQ will show in the visualiser the contents
of the selected Playback as if the Playback fader was at 100%. Only data
from the selected Playback is shown.

When set to “Next GO” MagicQ will show in the visualiser the output of
the console as it would appear if GO was pressed on the selected
Playback. When the selected Playback has multiple steps then MagicQ
always shows the next step in the Visualiser. If the selected Playback
is not active then MagicQ will show what would occur if the Playback was
activated.

Blind Visualisation and Preview Visualisation do not affect the normal
network outputs such as ArtNet, ACN, or Pathport. Only the DMX stream
sent directly to the Visualiser is affected.

When using Capture visualisation, Capture must be connected via CITP
universes rather than ArtNet – otherwise Capture will just show the
console output.
