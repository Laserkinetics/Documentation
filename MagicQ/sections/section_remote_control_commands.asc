== ChamSys Remote Protocol Commands
ChamSys remote protocol consists of simple commands consisting of a list
parameter values separated by commas ‘,’ and ending in a character A to
Z (or a to z). Commands can contain spaces, tabs, and carriage returns;
they are all ignored.

The remote protocol is split into remote playback commands and remote
programming commands.


=== Remote Playback Commands

The commands are:

|====
|<playback number> A| Activate playback
|<playback number> R| Release playback
|<playback number> T| Test playback (activate with level 100%)
|<playback number> U| Un-test playback (release with level 0%)
|<playback number> G| Go on playback
|<playback number> S| Stop (go back) on playback
|<playback number> B| Fast back on playback (no fade)
|<playback number> F| Fast forward on playback (no fade)
|<playback number> , <level> L| Set playback fader level
|<playback number> , <cue id> , <cue id dec>J| Jump to Cue Id on playback
|<page number> P| Change page
|<channel number> , <level> I| Set intensity channel to level
|<program command number> H| Remote programming command
|====

The following parameter values are supported

|====
|<playback number>|a number between 1 and 10
|<level>|an integer between 0 and 100.
|<page number>|an integer between 0 and 100
|<channel number>|an integer between 1 and 32769 DMX channel number
|<cue id>| an integer between 1 and 65536
|<cue id dec>| an integer between 0 and 99. Note that for Cue ID 1.5 use 50
|====

So for example, to set dimmer channel 4 to 50% you would use:

4,50I

To jump to Cue id 2.5 on playback 8 you would use:

8,2,50J

Commands can be sent back to back – e.g.

1A2A1S2G3,4I


==== Remote programming commands

Remote programming commands enable simple programming actions to be
carried out from a remote terminal. Remote programming commands consist
of the program command number followed by parameters and completed with
an “H”.

The commands are:

 \<01> , <start head> , [<end head>] H Select one or more heads
 \<02> , <start head> , [<end head>] H Deselect one or more heads
 \<03> H Deselect all heads
 \<04> , <group number> H Select group
 \<05> , <level> , [<time>] H Set intensity of selected heads
 \<06> , <attribute number> , <value> , [<time>] H Set attribute value of
selected heads
 \<07> , <attribute number> , <value> , [<16bit>] H Increase attribute of
selected heads
 \<08> , <attribute number> , <value> , [<16bit>] H Decrease attribute of
selected heads
 \<09> H Clear programmer
 \<10> , <palette id> H Include position palette
 \<11> , <palette id> H Include colour palette
 \<12> , <palette id> H Include beam palette
 \<13> , <cue id> H Include cue
 \<19> H Update
 \<20>, <palette id> H Record position palette
 \<21> , <palette id> H Record colour palette
 \<22> , <palette id> H Record beam palette
 \<23> , <cue id> H Record cue
 \<30> H Next head
 \<31> H Previous head
 \<32> H All heads
 \<40> H Locate
 \<41> H Lamp on
 \<42> H Lamp off
 \<43> H Reset
 \<71>, <state> H Remote trigger
 \<80> , <cue id> H Test Cue
 \<81> , <cue id> H Untest Cue
 \<82> , <cue stack id> H Test Cue Stack
 \<83> , <cue stack id> H Untest Cue Stack
 \<90> , <showfile id> H Save show showXXXX.shw
 \<91> , <showfile id> H Load show showXXXX.shw
 
 [] indicates an optional parameter

 <level> is an integer between 0 and 100
 <palette id> is an integer between 1 and 1024
 <cue id> is an integer between 1 and 5000
 <16 bit> is a flag. 0 for change in 8 bit resolution, 1 for change in 16 bit resolution
 <time> is an integer time in seconds
 <group number> is an integer between 1 and 200
 <start head> and <end head> are integers between 1 and 6145
 <showfile id> is a four digit decimal number between 0000 and 9999.
 <state> is 0 or 1 states, or 2 is toggle current state.
