== Cue Stack Options
The Cue Stack Window has three Views – View Cue Stack, View Options and
View Defaults.

The View Options view shows the settings for the Cue Stack on the
current Playback. Changing these settings immediately affects the
currently selected Cue Stack.

The View Defaults view shows the settings that will be used when new
Cues and Cue Stacks are recorded. Changing the settings in View Defaults
does not affect Cues and Cues Stacks that have already been recorded.

The View Defaults view contains two columns – one for single step Cue
Stacks and one for multiple step Cue Stacks. When the first Cue is first
recorded on a Cue Stack the single step defaults are used. When a second
Cue is recorded on the Cue Stack the Cue Stack settings are modified to
use the multiple step defaults.


=== Faders

==== Fader activates stack

When set to Yes raising the fader from 0 to above the activation
threshold activates the Cue Stack. When set to No the fader does not
activate the Cue Stack.

The activation threshold defaults to 0. It is a global setting which is
set in Setup, View Settings, Hardware.


==== Fader releases stack

When set to Yes lowering the fader to the activation threshold releases
the Cue Stack. When set to No the fader does Not release the Cue Stack.

The activation threshold defaults to 0. It is a global setting which is
set in Setup, View Settings, Hardware.


==== Fader controls HTP chans

When set to Yes the fader will control the level of all channels that
are patched as HTP channels. Typically this is only Intensity channels
although sometimes it is useful to patch fixtures without Intensity as
HTP – e.g. the Red, Green, Blue channels of LED fixtures.

The fader controls the levels proportionately from 0% to 100% through
the length of the fader.

If the Cue includes FX on HTP channels then the size of the FX is also
reduced proportionately according to the fader level.

When this setting is set to Yes then the other “Fader controls” settings
should generally be set to No.

The overall intensity level of HTP channels is also affected by the
Grand Master and the Sub Master and any active Group Masters.



==== Fader controls LTP (IPCB) chans

When set to Yes the fader will control the value of all channels that
are patched as LTP channels – generally this is everything apart from
Intensity.

When the fader is at 0% the LTP channels are not controlled by this Cue
Stack. When the fader is raised above 0% then MagicQ crossfades the LTP
channels to the values stored in the Cue under control of the fader.
When the fader is at 100% then the LTP channels are exactly as stored in
the Cue.

MagicQ crossfades the LTP channels from the values that they were at
before the fader was raised above 0 – i.e. the current value of these
channels. This will either be the values from other Cue Stacks, or if No
other Cue Stacks are controlling these channels the LTP or default
values.

When set to Yes then the other “Fader controls” settings should
generally be set to No.


==== Fader controls FX size

When this setting is set to Yes the fader controls the size of any FX
that are running in the Cue Stack – this includes FX from the current
Cue and also any FX that are tracking from previous Cues in the Cue
Stack.

When the fader is at 100% then the FX is the size that was recorded in
the Cue - lowering the fader reduces the size until there is No size (No
FX) at 0%.

Fader controls size affects FX on any attribute.

When set to Yes then the other “Fader controls” settings other than
“Fader controls speed” settings should generally be set to No.


==== Fader controls FX speed

When this setting is set to Yes the fader controls the speed of any FX
that are running in the Cue Stack – this includes FX from the current
Cue and also any FX that are tracking from previous Cues in the Cue
Stack.

When the fader is at 100% then the FX runs at the speed that was
recorded in the Cue - lowering the fader reduces the speed until it
stops at 0%.

Fader controls speed affects FX on any attribute.

When set to Yes then the other “Fader controls” settings other than
“Fader controls size” settings should generally be set to No.


==== Fader controls manual crossfades

When set to Yes then the other “Fader controls” settings should
generally be set to No.


=== Buttons

==== Flash activates stack

When set to Yes pressing the Flash button activates the Cue Stack and
sets the level of the Playback to 100%.

When set to No pressing the Flash button sets the level of the Playback
to 100% but does not activate the Cue Stack.

The overall level of HTP channels is also affected by the Grand Master
and Sub Master and any active Group Masters. The Sub Master can be
configured in Setup to be an Add Swap Master.


==== Flash releases stack

When set to Yes releasing the Flash button releases the Cue Stack and
sets the level of the Playback to 0%.

When set to No pressing the Flash button sets the level of the Playback
to 0% but does not release the Cue Stack.

Note that if the option Fader Activates Stack is set to Yes then
releasing of the Playback is also dependent on the fader. If the
Playback was activated by raising the fader then pressing the Flash
button will not release the Playback. In this case the Playback will
only be released by lowering the fader to 0% or by pressing the Rel
button. This allows the Flash button to be used both to bump in a Cue
which was not activated by fader, and to also bump a Cue to 100% which
was activated by the fader at a lower level.


==== Flash always swaps

When set to Yes, pressing the Flash button will always act as a Swap
rather than an Add, regardless of the state of the Add/Swap button. When
the button is pressed the Intensity of all other active Playbacks will
be set to 0%. When the button is released the other Playbacks will be
restored to their previous level.

When this option is set Yes then the LED in the Flash button will always
be red.

==== Flash acts as Go/Pause

When set to Yes, pressing the Flash button acts as if the Go button had
been pressed and pressing Shift + the Flash button acts as if the PAUSE
button had been pressed. When set this way the button does Not act as a
bump button.

When set to No the Flash button acts as a bump button in the normal way.

Holding Shift and pressing Flash will perform Pause instead of Go.

When set to Yes the settings “Flash activates Stack”, “Flash releases
Stack” and “Flash toggles” are ignored.

==== Flash acts as Flash + Go

When set to Yes the Flash button acts as both a Flash button and a Go
button.

Pressing the Flash button performs the Go function – this will active
the Cue Stack, or if the Cue Stack is already active, it will Go to the
next step. At the same time the Flash button will operate in the Normal
way, setting the Playback level to 100%.

Releasing the Flash button will set the Playback level back to 0% or if
the fader is raised to the leve l of the fader.

Holding SHIFT and pressing the Flash button will perform Flash + Pause.

Normally when “Flash acts as Flash + Go” is set Yes then the setting
“Flash Releases Stack” should be set to No. If the option “Flash
Releases Stack” is set to Yes then releasing the Flash button will also
release the Playback unless the fader is raised.

When set to Yes, the setting “Flash acts as Go/PAuse” is ignored.

==== Flash toggles

When set to Yes the Flash button acts as a toggle rather than a bump.
Pressing the button the first time activates the Playback. Pressing the
button again releases the Playback.

When this option is set and the playback is active the LED in the Flash
button Flashes to indicate the toggle mode is latched.

When set to Yes, the settings “Flash activates Stack” and “Flash
releases Stack” are ignored.


==== Flash acts like fader

When set to Yes the Flash button has the same effect as if the fader has
temporarily been raised to 100%. This is useful for enabling the FLASH
button to control attributes other Intensity. For example if the fader
is set to control FX size then pressing the Flash button would act like
the fader being fully raised – so 100% FX size.


==== Go jumps out of loop

This setting affects Cues that are set to Chase Timing which are in a
loop. When set to Yes, pressing Go will exit the loop – jumping to the
step after the Cue that loops back to an earlier Cue. When set to No,
pressing Go will step one step within the chase.


==== Go exits loop after end

This setting has no effect.


==== Go stop/starts

When set to Yes then pressing GO stops a Cue that is already running or
starts a Cue that is stopped.

When set to No then pressing GO starts the next Cue.


==== Pause swaps

When set to Yes the Pause button acts as a Flash button in Swap
mode.

Pressing the Pause button the Playback will be set to 100% and the
Intensity of all other active Playbacks will be set to 0%. When the
button is released the other Playbacks will be restored to their
previous level.

This setting enables a Playback to have both an Add button and a Swap
button.

==== Pause releases

When set to Yes the Pause button releases the Cue Stack.


=== Function

==== Cue Stack is an Intensity Master

When this setting is set to Yes then the Cue Stack behaves as an
Intensity Master. The Cue Stack normal Cue execution behaviour is
disabled.

If the Group Id settings is non zero then the channels stored in the
Group specified by the Group Id specify the channels that are under
control of the Intensity Master. Updating the channels stored within a
Group updates the channels under control of the Intensity Master. . If
there is no Group recorded for the Group Id then the Cue Stack has no
effect.

If the Group Id setting is set to 0 then the channels stored in the
first Cue are used to determine which channels are under control of the
Intensity Master. The actual levels of the channels in the first Cue is
not important – only that the Channels have some level in the Cue.

In order for the Intensity Master to be activated the Go button must be
pressed. To release the Intensity Master the Playback must be selected
and the REL button pressed. The Button settings “Flash activates Stack”
and “Flash releases Stack” are ignored. In order to avoid sudden changes
in output level the fader should be raised to 100% before activating or
releasing.

When the fader is at 100% then the Cue Stack has no effect. As the fader
is lowered then all the channels under control have their intensity
reduced.

It is possible to have multiple Intensity Masters that control the same channel which work proportionately.

Normally when this setting is set to Yes, the settings Cue Stack is a
Size Master and Cue stack is a Speed Master should be set to No.

When this setting is set to No then the Cue Stack behaves normally.


==== Cue Stack is a Size Master

When this setting is set to Yes then the Cue Stack behaves as an FX Size
Master. The Cue Stack normal Cue execution behaviour is disabled.

The channels stored in the first Cue are used to determine which
channels are under control of the Intensity Master. The actual levels of
the channels in the first Cue is not important – only that the Channels
have some level in the Cue.

In order for the Intensity Master to be activated the Go button must be
pressed. To release the Intensity Master the Playback must be selected
and the REL button pressed. The Button settings “Flash activates Stack”
and “Flash releases Stack” are ignored. In order to avoid sudden changes
in output level the fader should be raised to 100% before activating or
releasing.

When the fader is at 100% then FX size is as programmed. As the fader is
lowered then the FX size is reduced until it reaches zero size at 0%.

A particular channel can only be controlled from one FX Size Master.

Normally when this setting is set to Yes, the setting Cue Stack is an
Intensity Master should be set to No. It is possible to have a Cue Stack
set to both a Size Master and a Speed Master.

When this setting is set to No then the Cue Stack behaves normally.


==== Cue Stack is a Speed Master

When this setting is set to Yes then the Cue Stack behaves as an FX
Speed Master. The Cue Stack normal Cue execution behaviour is disabled.

The channels stored in the first Cue are used to determine which
channels are under control of the Intensity Master. The actual levels of
the channels in the first Cue is not important – only that the Channels
have some level in the Cue.

In order for the Intensity Master to be activated the Go button must be
pressed. To release the Intensity Master the Playback must be selected
and the REL button pressed. The Button settings “Flash activates Stack”
and “Flash releases Stack” are ignored. In order to avoid sudden changes
in output level the fader should be raised to 100% before activating or
releasing.

When the fader is at 100% then FX size is as programmed. As the fader is
lowered then the FX size is reduced until it reaches zero size at 0%.

A particular channel can only be controlled from one FX Speed Master.

Normally when this setting is set to Yes, the setting Cue Stack is an
Intensity Master should be set to No. It is possible to have a Cue Stack
set to both a Size Master and a Speed Master.

When this setting is set to No then the Cue Stack behaves normally.


==== Group ID (0 is not used)

This setting is used when the setting Cue Stack is an Intensity Master
is set to Yes. It specifies the group to use as an Intensity Master.

This setting has no effect on FX Size Masters and FX Speed Masters.


==== Cue stack is a Prog Master

The Playback with this Cue Stack operates as a
<<_Programmer_Master,Programmer Master>>.

==== Intensity Master to 200%

When Cue Stack is an Intensity Master is set to yes, then the fader will operate from 0% to 200% intensity.  Above 100% the level recorded in the Cue will be boosted - although the maximum level will always be 100%.


=== Activate/Release

==== Halt at last step

When set to Yes the Cue Stack halts at the last step in the Cue Stack.
When set to No then the Cue Stack will return to the first step after
the last step.


==== Release after last step

When set to Yes the Cue Stack automatically releases after the last step
in the Cue Stack has completed fading. When set to No the Cue Stack must
be released manually.


==== Release resets to first step

When set to Yes the Cue Stack always starts from the first step when the
Cue Stack is activated. The setting “Release steps 1 step” is ignored.

When set to No the Cue Stack activates at the step it was on when it was
last released.


==== Release steps 1 step

When set to Yes the Cue Stack activates at the step following the step
the Cue Stack was on when it was last released.

When the setting “Release resets to first step” is set to Yes, this
setting has no effect.

==== Release time

This is the time for channels to release when the Cue Stack is released
(using the REL button or via fader/flash button). The exact behaviour
depends upon whether channels are active on other Playbacks. Intensity
channels not used by other channels will fade out using the release
time.

The release time also affects channels that are released from Cue steps
within a Cue Stack step – i.e. when the Cue Stack step Tracking option is not set to LTP (“Rel old
chans” = yes)

This setting can also be set in the End field in View Cue in the Cue
Stack Window.


==== Activate on page change

When set to Yes, then this Cue Stack is activated when the page is
changed to the page that this Cue Stack is assigned to.

If there is an active Cue Stack on this Playback then the new Cue Stack
will only be activated if the old Cue Stack is set to release on page
change.


==== Release on page change

When set to Yes, then this Cue Stack is released when the page is
changed to any page other than the page that this Cue Stack is assigned
to.


==== HTP always active (Use HTP)

When set to Yes then the fader always controls the Intensity (HTP)
channels from the Cue Stack regardless of whether the Cue Stack is
activated. Whenever the fader is raised above zero the Intensity
channels will affect the Output. The highest level from this Cue Stack
and any other Playbacks will determine the Output level for each
channel.

This setting overrides the Advanced Setting “All Channels controlled
LTP”.

This setting is similar to the Use HTP setting on some other consoles.


=== Advanced

==== All chans controlled LTP

When set to Yes all HTP channels under control of the Playback act as if
they were LTP channels. When the Playback with this Cue Stack is the
latest activated and highest priority Playback then the Playback has
complete control of all HTP channels regardless of whether they are
active on other faders.

HTP channels that are active on higher priority Playbacks will be under
control of the higher priority Playback and will ignore this setting.

HTP channels that are active on other Playbacks with the same priority,
but which were activated/reasserted more recently than this Playback,
will be under control of the other Playbacks.


==== Block FX from other playbacks

When set to Yes then any channels controlled by this Playback block FX
on those channels from other Playbacks.

Channels controlled by this Playback that have levels but no FX are not
affected by FX on other Playbacks. In effect an implicit zero FX is
added to these channels to block the other Playbacks.

When set to No then channels controlled by this Playback that have
levels but no FX are affected by FX on those channels from other
Playbacks.


==== Masters affect level

When set to Yes then the levels of HTP channels (generally Intensity)
are affected by the grand master and sub master faders. Channels also
are affected by DBO and can be released by SHIFT RELEASE.

When set to No then the levels of HTP channels are not affected by the
grand master and sub master faders. They are also not affected by DBO or
by SHIFT RELEASE.

Note that Group Masters are not affected by this setting. Therefore even
with “Masters affect level” set to No, channels will still be affected
by Group Masters.


==== Playback priority

The Playback priority can be set to NORMAL, HIGH and ABOVE PROGRAMMER.

When all Playbacks are set to priority NORMAL then the latest Playback
to be activated/reasserted will control the channels.

Playbacks set to HIGH priority always have higher priority than
Playbacks set to NORMAL priority.

Playbacks set to ABOVE PROGRAMMER have higher priority than the
Programmer – in order to edit the Cues in the Programmer and see the
changes on the Output it is best to release the Cue Stack.


==== Move when dark

When set to Yes, then MagicQ checks after each Cue is executed whether
it should perform a move when dark.

Any heads that are used in the next Cue but which have 0% intensity in
the current cue are checked to see whether the Position, Beam and Colour
attributes should be preloaded before the next Cue is executed. If the
Position, Beam or Colour values are different from the current values
then the new values are crossfaded with a time of 3 seconds.

This option is similar to putting a Mark Cue before every Cue in a Cue
Stack.


==== Recalculate state on jumps

This option specifies how MagicQ calculates the Cue State when playing
back a Cue Stack.

When set to Yes, MagicQ recalculates the Cue State whenever a jump is
made in the Cue Stack. The Output of a particular Cue always appears the
same regardless of which Cue was executed preciously. MagicQ
recalculates the Output as if the Cue Stack had been played back from
the first Cue to this Cue by pressing the GO button.

When set to No, MagicQ calculates the Cue State based on the Cues that
it has actually executed – when jumping to a new Cue only the Cues that
have been previously executed will make up the Output.

In tracking modes this setting defaults to Yes. In non-tracking modes
this setting defaults to No.


==== Stomp other playbacks

Stomping enables Playbacks that have been completely overridden by other
Playbacks to be automatically released.

This option is only relevant when the Setup, Playback setting “Stomp
playbacks” is set. When “Stomp Playbacks” is set to No then this setting
is ignored.

When this setting is set to Yes then this Playback is allowed to stomp
other playbacks.

==== Sync next Playback to this one

This setting enables one or more playbacks to be synchronised together so that they step the same Cue Ids at the same time.  Setting this option to yes forces the next Playback (higher number) to synchronise to this Playback.  If enabled for playback PB10 then Wing 1 PB1 will be synced to it.

If you Go on this playback to a Cue Id that is not implemented on the next playback then the next playback will not change step.  It will only sync to steps where the Cue Ids match.

It is possible to synchronise multiple playbacks by enabling this setting on several adjacent playbacks.

==== External timecode

This setting affects any steps in this Cue Stack that have their Halt
field are set to “Timecode.

When set to Yes this Cue Stack is controlled by external timecode. When
set to No then this Cue Stack is controlled by internal timecode –
activating the Playback starts the timecode from 0.


==== Send playback state to other consoles

When set to Yes then the state of this Playback is sent to other MagicQ
consoles on the network.

If the Setup, Multi Console setting “Send Playback state to other
consoles” is set to Yes then the state of all Playbacks is sent to other
consoles regardless of this Cue Stack setting.

This setting requires Setup, Network, Ethernet Remote Protocol to be set
to “ChamSys TX” or “ChamSys TX and RX”.


=== Chase Options

==== Skip first times

When this setting is set to Yes, then when the Cue Stack is activated
the fade times for the first step are ignored and the levels bumped
straight in.

This only affects Cue steps set to “Chase Timing”.


==== Speed

This controls the speed of any Cue Steps in the Cue Stack set to “Chase
Timing”. This setting can also be controlled via encoder X in the Cue
Stack view.


==== Xfade

This controls the crossfade of any Cue Steps in the Cue Stack set to
“Chase Timing”. This setting can also be controlled via the Y encoder in
the Cue Stack view.


==== Direction

This controls the direction (forward or backward) of any Cue Steps in
the Cue Stack set to “Chase Timing”. This setting can also be controlled
via encoder C in the Cue Stack view.


==== Repeat type

The options are Normal, Bounce and Random. Bounce executes the Chase
alternating backward and forward direction. This setting can also be
controlled via encoder D in the Cue Stack view.


==== Number of repeats

This setting specifies how many repeats of the Chase should take place.

When set to 0 then the Chase will continue until the chase is exited
manually.


==== Running

This setting specifies whether Chases start running or halted.



=== Chase Times

==== HTP in fade, HTP out fade, Position fade, Colour fade, Beam fade

The fade times for any Cue Steps in the Cue Stack set to “Chase Timing”.
These times generally match the Chase speed. These times can also be
controlled via encoder C in the Cue Stack view.

Setting one or more attribute group fade times to 0 causes that
attribute group to snap rather than fade.

The overall Chase speed corresponds to attribute group with the biggest
combined delay and fade time.


HTP in delay, HTP out delay, Position delay, Colour delay, Beam delay

The delay times for any Cue Steps in the Cue Stack set to “Chase
Timing”.

These times can be used to make one or more attribute groups snap at
end.

The overall Chase speed corresponds to attribute group with the biggest
combined delay and fade time.


=== Audio

Audio Controls Fader Level

When set to Yes, the level of the playback is controlled by the received
audio level on the chosen. The level of the real fader is ignored. The
effect on the Playback is determined by the Cue Stack, Fader settings.

The Cue Stack must be active for the audio to take effect.

When this setting is set to Yes, the settings “Audio Bumps Go” and
“Audio sets BPM” should be set to No.

The setting can be used in conjunction with the setting “Audio jumps to
Cue Step”.

The audio level, audio parameter 1, and audio parameter 2 settings can
be used to fine tune how the received audio affects the fader level.


==== Audio bumps Go

When set to Yes, the Cue Stack bumps to the next step every time a peak
in the audio is detected on the specified channel. This enables a Cue
Stack to follow the beat of the music.

This is best used with the Cue Stack set to Cue Timing instead of Chase
Timing.

The Cue Stack must be active for the audio to take effect.

When this setting is set to Yes, the settings “Audio controls fader
level”, “Audio sets BPM” and “Audio jumps to Cue Step” should be set to
No.

Audio parameter 1 is used as a divider – set it between 2 and 16 to
divide the received beat frequency by a value between 2 and 16 times.

Audio parameter 2 should be set to 0.


==== Audio sets BPM

When set to Yes, then the chase speed of the Cue Stack is set to the
timing of the peaks on the specified audio channel. The Cue Stack should
be set to Chase Timing.

The Cue Stack must be active for the audio to take effect.

When this setting is set to Yes, the settings “Audio controls fader
level”, “Audio bumps Go” and “Audio jumps to Cue Step” should be set to
No.

Audio level, audio parameter 1, and audio parameter 2 should be set to
0.


==== Audio jumps to Cue Step

“Audio jumps to Cue Step” enables the level of the specified audio
channel to determine which step in the Cue Stack is executed – for
example if you have a Cue Stack with 10 steps, then a level of 0% will
execute step 1, 10% will execute step 2 whilst a level of 100% will
execute step 10. This is very useful if you wish to program different
Cues onto LED or media servers.

The Cue Stack must be active for the audio to take effect.

When this setting is set to Yes, the settings “Audio bumps Go” and
“Audio jumps to Cue Step” should be set to No.

If the setting “Audio Controls fader level” is set to YES then audio
level, audio parameter 1, and audio parameter 2 will affect the level of
the Playback and hence the Cue step chosen.


==== Audio channel

This setting specifies the audio channel that the Playback will respond
to.

The ChamSys audio interface supports 7 different frequency bands on two
audio inputs (left and right).

Selecting the option “Energy” uses all frequency bands mixed together.


==== Audio level

When “Audio controls fader level” is set to Yes then the settings Audio
parameter 1 and Audio Parameter 2 can be set to control the response:

Audio P1 = 0 Normal (direct trigger from level)

Audio P1 = 1 Decayed (decays by Audio P2 each sample)

Audio P1 = 2 Pulse (triggers at Audio Level, Audio P2 is duration of
pulse)

Audio P1 = 3 Pulse decay (triggers at Audio Level, decays by Audio P2
each sample)

Audio P1 = 4 Switch (triggers to on/off at Audio Level)

Audio P1 = 5 Slow (increases/decreases by Audio P2 each sample)

These parameters are ignored for the settings “Audio Bumps Go” and
“Audio sets BPM”, and “Audio jumps to Cue Step”

When the setting “Audio Bumps Go” is set to Yes, then Audio P1 acts as a
divider - from 2 to 64 so that the Cue Stack is bumped at a slower rate
than the audio input.

==== Audio parameter 1

See <<_audio_level,Audio level>> above.

==== Audio parameter 2

See <<_audio_level,Audio level>> above.

=== Step (View Defaults only)

==== Step controlled as a chase

When set to Yes, the step defaults to Chase timing. When set to No the
step defaults to Cue timing.



==== Step follows last

When set to Yes, the step executes after the completion of the previous
step. When set to No the step executes after the wait time specified in
the Cue step.



==== Step halts before executing

When set to Yes, the step halts and waits for the user to pres GO before
executing the Cue step.

When set to No the step executes immediately after the previous step has
completed – this is either after it has completed fading (when “Step
follows last” is set to YES) or immediately after the wait time has
expired.

When “Step Controlled as Chase” is Yes then this setting is normally set
to No so that the chase runs step to step without user interaction.

When “Step Controlled as Chase” is No then this setting is normally set
to Yes so that the Cue Stack is executed step by step under user
control.
