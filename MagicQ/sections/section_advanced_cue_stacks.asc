== Advanced Playback / Cue Stack Options

=== Interaction of HTP and LTP channels between Playbacks

Channels are set as either HTP (Highest Takes Priority) or LTP (Latest
Takes Priority) in their personality file – the property can be edited
in the Head Editor.

By default, Playbacks use the HTP / LTP property to determine how
channels are controlled from multiple playbacks simultaneously. For HTP
channels the highest level will be output, for LTP channels the highest
priority or latest touched playback will control the channel.

This operation can be modified on a per Cue Stack basis.


=== HTP handling

The console handles HTP (Highest Takes Precedence) channels in a very
simple way - the highest value from all the playbacks, the programmer
and the preset faders is the value that is output.

If the "Programmer overrides HTP chans" option is enabled then any HTP
channels in the programmer will override channels on the playbacks.
Channels on preset faders still affect the output.

The console supports a powerful swap mode selected through the ADD/SWAP
button. In SWAP mode when a FLASH button for a playback is pressed then
the HTP channels from all other playbacks are disregarded. Only
playbacks with a FLASH button pressed affect the HTP output. Similarly,
the programmer and preset faders have no effect on HTP output.

FX and channel values are handled independently enabling operators to
program one playback with channel values and one with FX. For example
one playback could have an ambient level whilst another has a dimmer
chase. The FX is added to the highest channel value.

Note that if a Cue Stack on a Playback is set to “All chans controlled
LTP” then when that Playback is activated as the last touched playback
then all channels controlled by that Playback are considered to be LTP.
Thus that Playback will exclusively control the levels of all channels
used by the Cue Stack.


=== HTP always active (Use HTP) option

By default HTP channels programmed in a Playback only affect output when
the Playback is active. It is possible to make a Playback so that the
activation of the Playback is separated from the operation of the HTP
channels using the “HTP always active (Use HTP)” in Cue Stack options,
Activate/Release.

When this option is set, then HTP channels on the playback will be
output whenever the fader is above the activation point (defaults 0)
regardless of the other activate options on the Cue Stack. They will
only be released when the fader is taken back down to 0. They are not
affected by pressing the RELEASE or the SHIFT RELEASE buttons.

If a Playback is set to “HTP Always Active” then raising the fader or
pressing the FLASH button will not use any specified Intensity delay or
fade times. If the Cue Stack has multiple steps then delay and fade
times will still be used when changing steps – i.e. pressing the GO or
PAUSE buttons.

The “HTP always active (Use HTP)” has priority over the “All chans
controlled LTP” option – therefore HTP channels on playbacks will be
output regardless of any other higher priority faders with “All chans
controlled LTP”.

LTP channels will be activated in the normal way – i.e. by pressing GO,
or if the “Fader activates” option is set by moving the fader upwards.
If the “Flash activates” option is set then pressing the FLASH button
will also activate the channels.

When one of the main faders has HTP levels active then it is coloured
orange. Only once the playback is activated fully will it be coloured
red.

Note that this option affects all channels that are patched as HTP
channels (normally only Intensity – but potentially other attributes if
desired).


=== LTP handling

The MagicQ console provides powerful handling of LTP (Latest Takes
Precedence) channels allowing new effects to be “bumped” onto
intelligent heads for a period of time before reverting to the previous
effect.

Note that several other consoles handle LTP channels in a less intuitive
way - when the last active playback is returned to zero then the values
on that playback still control the channel rather than reverting to the
previous raised playback that is still active.

The programmer always over-rides playbacks. If a LTP channel is active
in the programmer then playbacks will be disregarded for this channel.

FX and channel values are handled independently enabling operators to
program one playback with channel values and one with FX. For example
one playback could have MAC500 positions (channels) whilst another has
MAC500 movements (FX).


=== Interaction of FX between Playbacks

By default, the FX and levels on MagicQ operate independently so it is
possible to have a FX running on one Playback and the level (base values
that the FX is applying to) coming from a separate Playback.

Only one FX is ever active on a particular channel, so the FX from the
last touched playback will over-ride any FX for that channel from other
playbacks.

If a Playback has a Cue with both a FX and a level for a channel then
that will Playback controls then the output will be the level plus the
FX from that Playback.

If a Playback has a Cue with only a level for a channel (i.e. no FX),
then a FX may be added to that level from another active Playback.

It is possible to set the Cue Stack option “Ignore FX from other
Playbacks” so that when the Playback is the last touched Playback, any
FX from other Playbacks are ignored, regardless of whether this Playback
has FX for these channels.

It is also possible to set the Cue Option “Block FX” to block other
Playbacks with FX from affecting the levels in a particular Cue. Note
that when the option “Programmer overrides FX” is active (e.g. in Hog II
Warp mode) then Cues are automatically recorded with the “Block FX”
option set. The Cue option “Block FX” can be viewed and changed in the
Cue Stack Window (page right).


An alternative way to block FX from other Playbacks is to use “Add FX
Zero Size” in Cues where you wish to block other Playbacks.


=== Playback Priority

By default all playbacks have the same priority. It is possible to set a
playback to maximum priority using the Cue Stack option “Highest
Playback priority”. The options are:

* Normal – same priority as other playbacks – last activated has control
* Mid – above Normal but lower than programmer
* High – highest priority of all playbacks but lower priority than the
programmer
* Above Programmer – higher than playbacks and the programmer

When the Cue Stack has highest priority, LTP channels under control of
the playback are not affected by other playbacks. HTP channels continue
to operate as normal.

=== Playbacks ignore masters levels

Sometimes it is necessary to program playbacks that are not affected by
the Grand Master or Sub Master. Use the “Masters do not affect level”
option to prevent the Cue Stack being affected by the master faders –
this is useful for controlling channels that must stay up – e.g. house
lights, smoke machines etc… Cue Stacks set with this option are not
affected by grand master, sub master, DBO button.

Cue Stacks with this option set are not released by pressing SHIFT RELEASE to release all playbacks.


=== Playback Stomping

There is a Playback Stomping option in the Setup Window, View Settings, Playback.
With this option enabled playbacks that have been fully overridden by
other playbacks will be automatically released (stomped).

This is useful in some environments such as night-clubs where the
operator wishes to continually play back new functions without having to
turn off the older functions.

There is a choice of Stomping - LTP or both LTP and HTP.

When set to just LTP then playbacks that contain HTP channels are never
released (stomped) as they may still be affecting the output. When set
to LTP and HTP then playbacks are stomped if all of the LTP channels
have been overridden by another playback and the HTP channels are at the
same or higher level in another playback.

When using the Playback Stomping option it is possible to allow some
playbacks to be marked as “non stomping”. This enables certain playbacks
to be bumped in without stomping over the original playback.



=== Group Masters (Inhibit Masters)

Playbacks can be used to control groups of channels – you can assign a
playback to be a master for Intensities, FX size or FX speed for a
specified set of heads. Using Intensity Masters you can make an “Inhibit
Master” to give overall control for the levels of a group of channels.

Group Masters are activated and released in the same way as normal Cue
Stacks. When you set Cue Stacks to be Intensity Masters, FX Speed or FX
Size Masters it is not necessary to set Fader Activates Stack to No and
Fader Releases Stack to No. MagicQ will ignore these settings and always
activate only using the GO button and release using the RELEASE button.

When editing the channels in a Group Masters you should ensure that the
fader is released before you make the edit.

Note that the channel levels, times, and FX information in the Cue that
is used as the Group Master are ignored and hence do not affect the
output in any way.


==== Intensity Masters

===== Group based Intensity Masters

To make an Intensity Master based on a Group simply clear the
programmer, then select the Group and record to a Playback. Make sure
that there are no active channels in the programmer. MagicQ will
automatically create a Group Master, setting the Cue Stack Options,
Function, Intensity Master = Yes and setting the Cue Stack Options,
Function, Group Id to the selected Group.

If required, the group associated with an Intenity Master can be changed
in Cue Stack Options, Function. When a group number other than 0 is set
in the Cue Stack Options, Function menu then MagicQ automatically edits
and generates the Cue assigned to the first step in that Cue Stack.
Ensure you set the group id on the correct Cue Stack.

You can have multiple Group Masters that control one channel – they will
work together.


===== Channel based Intensity Masters

Record a cue with the channels that you wish to control - the level of
the channels can be any level as long as the channel is in the
programmer. Then set the Cue Stack option "Fader is an Intensity
Master".

Activate the playback (press GO or raise the fader) and now it acts as
an Intensity Master. Press RELEASE to stop the master having any effect.


==== FX Size and FX Speed Master

To make a FX Size or FX Speed Master you record a single Cue onto a
Playback that contains the attributes that you wish to control.

To make a FX size master for pan movement, record a cue with only the
pan attribute in the programmer for the heads you wish to control. Then
set the Cue Stack option "Fader is a Size Master". Activate the playback
and now it acts as a FX Size Master for pan movement.

You can set-up multiple FX Size and FX Speed Masters – however you
should only have one Master of each type to control each head –
otherwise there is a conflict.



=== Advanced activate and release options

The FLASH button can be set to release the Cue Stack using the “Flash
releases stack” option. This option works in a slightly different way
depending on the “Fader releases stack”.

When “Fader releases stack” = “no” (Theatre, Hog II Warp modes),
pressing and then releasing the FLASH button will always release the
stack regardless of the fader level. When “Fader releases stack” = “yes”
(Normal mode), pressing and releasing the FLASH button will only release
the Cue Stack if the fader is at 0.

The Cue Stack can be configured in different ways to affect whether the
Cue Stack resets to the first step on release, whether it stays at the
current step, or whether it moves on one step.
