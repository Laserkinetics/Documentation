== Playback

MagicQ consoles support 10 main playbacks situated immediately below the
touch screen. Up to 192 additional playbacks available on up to 8 expansion wings.

All playbacks have a fader, a FLASH button and a SELECT button.

The 10 main playbacks also have GO and PAUSE buttons for control of Cue
Stacks.

Cue Stacks on wings have GO buttons.  SHIFT + GO gives PAUSE function.


=== Playback Display

The area above each of the main playbacks on the display is used to
provide information about the status of the playback. This includes the
name of the Cue Stack that is loaded on the playback, the current Cue
and the next Cue. The status of the Cue is shown as a percentage along
with an indication of whether the Cue is running or paused.

The LCD screen above each of the Playbacks on the Playback Wings and Execute Wings displays the name of the Cue Stack. The name can
be up to 12 characters. When a Cue Stack is assigned to Wing Playbacks
that has multiple steps then the name of the Cue Stack is displayed on
the first line of the Wing Playback and the second line shows the
current step. If no name is set for the Cue Stack then the first line
shows the current step and the second line shows the next step.


=== Activating and Releasing Playbacks

Playbacks are activated and released by pressing the associated buttons
and raising the associated faders depending on the options of the Cue
Stack. Once a playback is activated it affects the output of the console
until it is released.

By default the Cue Stack on a playback is activated when the fader is
raised above zero and released when it is returned to zero. Similarly it
is activated when a flash button is pressed and then deactivated when
the button is released.

The Cue Stack options can be configured so that the flash buttons/faders do not affect activation or deactivation. In this
case the playback can be activated by pressing the GO button. It can be released by pressing the S button to make the playback the current playback and then pressing
the RELEASE button.

The Cue Stack can also be configured so that it does not reset to the
first step when it is released.

A Cue Stack can be set so that pressing the FLASH button, activates and
releases the playback on alternate presses. Set the “Flash Button
toggles” option.

A release time can be set for the Cue Stack in the Cue Stack options, so
that when released the levels fade out over a specified time.

At any time a playback can be released with time by pressing the SELECT
button of the playback, typing a time and pressing the RELEASE button.

Pressing SHIFT + RELEASE releases all playbacks simultaneously. It is
also possible to enter a time before doing SHIFT + RELEASE. Holding a
single SELECT button and pressing SHIFT + RELEASE releases all the
playbacks except the one for which the SELECT is held.

Holding multiple Select buttons and pressing RELEASE releases all the
selected playbacks.


=== Fader control

By default the playback fader controls the level of any HTP channels
recorded into the current Cue on the Cue Stack. If the “Fader controls
HTP chans” option is set to “No” then the fader will no longer control
the HTP channels – the Playback will automatically be always set to 100%
level.

The Cue Stack options can be configured so that the fader also controls
LTP channels using the Fader controls LTP (IPCB) option. This is useful
for example, to set up a fader to perform a "fly away" at the end of a
song. As the fader is moved up the LTP channels are changed from their
current values to the values recorded in the Cue.

MagicQ supports an additional option “All chans controlled LTP”. This
options allows the Playback when it is the last activated, to consider
all channels to be LTP. The value of HTP channels controlled by the
Playback is the value output, regardless of the HTP level of other
Playbacks. This allows soloing of Intensities.

The Cue Stack can also be configured so that the fader controls the size
and/or speed of any FX recorded in the current Cue. Thus, for example,
you can set up one fader to control a pan swing and another to control a
tilt swing. Moving the faders to half gets a small circle whilst moving
to full gets a big circle. Varying the faders enables generation of
ellipses.


=== Playback Buttons

In a Cue Stack set to Chase timing, GO runs the chase whilst PAUSE stops it.

In a Cue Stack set to Theatre timing, GO steps to the next step in the Cue Stack.  When a Cue Stack is fading, pressing PAUSE stops the fade mid step.  When a Cue Stack is paused, pressing PAUSE fades backwards through the
stack.

Pressing S + GO steps to the next step without fading.  Pressing S + PAUSE steps back to the previous step without fading.

Pressing S + FLASH reasserts the Cue Stack to be the latest touched - this has the effect of reasserting channels that have been overriden by other Playbacks.

Each of the buttons illuminates to indicate its current state:

|===
|FLASH|Green|Add
||Red|Swap
||Green flash|Add - playback held over
||Red flash|Swap - playback held over
|GO|Green|Cue Stack is running
|PAUSE|Red|Cue Stack is paused
|SELECT|Blue|Playback is selected
|===


==== Grand Master & Sub Master

To the left of the 10 playbacks are two master faders - a Grand Master
which controls the overall HTP output level of the console, and a Sub
Master which controls the HTP output level of the playbacks. In addition
the Sub Master can be <<_grand_master_sub_master,configured>> to
control the level of the FLASH buttons.

Both the Grand Master and the Sub Master have FLASH buttons which
respectively bump the overall HTP output level, and the HTP output level
of the playbacks to full.

LTP channels are not affected by the master faders.


==== Dead Black Out (DBO)

Above the Grand Master there is a DBO button. Pressing this button
causes all HTP values to be set to zero, thus generating a black out.
Releasing the button causes the original HTP levels to be restored. LTP
channels are not affected by the DBO button.


==== Add / Swap

Above the Grand Master there is an ADD / SWAP button which controls the
function of the playback FLASH buttons. When set to ADD, pressing a
FLASH button causes the playback to be added to the output. When set to
SWAP, pressing a FLASH button again causes the playback to be added to
the output, but all other playbacks are removed from the output.

Each FLASH button has an LED which is lit green for ADD and red for
SWAP.

The ADD / SWAP functionality only affects HTP channels on the playbacks
- LTP channels are not affected by the FLASH buttons. The level of the
playback is determined by the master faders – see
<<_grand_master_sub_master,configuring the masters>>.

Cue Stacks can be set to always swap. Open the Cue Stack window and
press the SELECT button with the playback. In the VIEW OPTIONS view set
the "Flash Button Swaps" option to YES.

The “Flash acts like fader” option enables the FLASH button to act as if
the fader was raised to full. This is useful if the fader controls LTP
(IPCB) channels, FX size or FX speed, or if the Fader is a master for
intensity, size or speed.


==== Page Select

Above the Sub Master are NEXT PAGE and a PREV PAGE buttons. These
control which playback page is active, and hence which Cue Stacks the
physical playback faders and buttons control.

The current page number and name is displayed in the Status Display under the clock.  The current page can also be changed from the Page
Window by selecting a new page, or by pressing PAGE and entering the
page number on the keypad.

Changing the current page whilst playbacks are active does not affect
the output of these playbacks - the playbacks are "held over" until the
playback is released.

It is possible to set up Cue Stacks to be activated and released on a
page change in the Cue Stack options.

The next Page can be preloaded in the Page Window by moving the cursor
to the required item in the Page Window and pressing the PRELOAD PAGE
soft button. The preloaded page will be indicated in the Status Display
above PB1 to PB5. Pressing NEXT PAGE goes to the preloaded page.

The preloaded page can also be loaded using the keypad syntax <Page>
<number> *. So PAGE 34 * preloads page 34. Pressing NEXT PAGE goes to
page 34.


==== Current Playback

The current playback is the one that has its SELECT button illuminated.  The current playback is used by the Cue and Cue Stack windows to
determine the Cue and Cue Stack to view / modify.

You can change the current playback at any time by pressing the SELECT
button for the playback you want to make the current playback

Press the SELECT button of a Playback twice in quick succession to
select the Playback and automatically open the Cue Stack Window so that
you can view / change the contents of the Cue Stack.

Press the SELECT button of a Playback three times in quick succession to
select the Playback and automatically open the Cue Stack Window in the
Options View.

Sometimes you may wish that the currently selected fader changes to
follow the last fader that was raised. This behaviour can be enables
from the Setup Window by setting the "Current Playback follows last
touched" option to YES.


==== Playbacks across multiple Pages

Multiple Playbacks can be active at one time from different pages.  However a particular Playback can only be active on one Page – it is not
possible to activate Playback 1 on Page 1 and Playback 1 on Page 2 at
the same time.

It is possible to temporarily transfer a Playback that is active to a
different Playback in order to unblock a Playback. Press SHIFT + SEL to
action the transfer, and then select the S button of the Playback to
transfer followed by the S button of the destination.

Transfer is only possible when a Playback is active. Once a transfer has
occurred the original Playback can be used to run a Playback from a
different page. When the transferred Playback is released then it
returns to its original Playback.


==== Manual Control

To the right of the 10 playbacks is the manual control section,
consisting of a Manual Fader, four buttons (GO, PAUSE, FWD, BKWD) and an
extra large GO button below the fader. This section controls the current
playback – that is the playback whose SELECT button is illuminated.

Pressing the SELECT button associated with a playback causes that
playback to become the current playback and hence to be controlled by
the manual section.

When a playback is controlled by the manual section, the playbacks fader
and buttons continue to function as normal so that the HTP level can be
set using the fader and the playback can be bumped using the FLASH
button. The manual section simply provides extra control features above
those available on each of the playbacks.

The GO and PAUSE buttons in the manual section have the same function as
the GO and PAUSE buttons on each playback. The FWD and BKWD buttons move
through the Cue stack without fading. The extra large GO button below
the Manual Fader is designed for theatre style playback and has the same
function as the GO button on each playback.

If multiple SELECT buttons are held down then the Go, Pause, Fast Forward
and Fast Back buttons in the manual control section can be used to
control multiple Playbacks simultaneously.

The Manual Fader is unlike all the other faders in that it controls the
progress of the current CUE rather than the HTP level of the Cue Stack.
This enables a Cue to be manually faded, the level of the Manual Fader
representing the % of the fade that is complete - from 0% to 100%.

The Manual Fader enables you to in a Cue Stack. To start a manual
crossfade, hold the SELECT button for the playback and move the
crossfader. The display window will show "pickup" until the crossfader
level matches the current position in the fade - it will then change to
"manual". You can also start a manual crossfade on the currently
selected playback by holding SHIFT and moving the crossfader.

As the fader reaches the limits the Cue Stack moves to the next Cue.


==== Goto

The GO buttons in the manual section can also be used to jump to
different Cue id in a Cue Stack – enter the Cue ID in the Cue Stack and
press the Go button in the manual section.

It is also possible to perform a Goto and a Preload of the next step to
got to in the Cue Stack Window.


==== Manual Split Crossfade

Two faders may be assigned as theatre style split crossfade masters.

When enabled from the Setup Window, playbacks faders 9 and 10 become
Crossfade Masters for manual Fade In and Fade Out. Pressing the Pause button
on either playback 9 or 10 brings the current playback under manual
control.

The two faders can then be used to fade in each new Cue with separate
control for fade in and fade out.

Pressing the Go button on either Playback 9 or 10 returns the current
playback to normal Cue execution.

When enabled, playbacks faders 9 and 10 can not be used as normal
playbacks.


==== Rate Sub Master

It is possible in the Setup Window to set the function of manual
crossfade fader to be a rate sub-master to control the execution rate
of the current playback, or the global execution rate of all playbacks.
The rate is shown in the bottom right of the Status Display from 0% to
infinity. The fader should be set to 50% for normal execution rate.

The options are:

* Rate Master
* Global Rate Master
* Cue Stack Rate Master
* Cue Stack Global Rate Master
* Tested Stacks Rate Master

The Rate Master and Global Master affect both the Cue Stack times, FX
times and Pixel FX times. The Cue Stack Rate Master and Cue Stack Global
Rate Master control just the rate of the Cue Stack (not the FX in it).

Tested Stacks Rate Master – only tested Cue Stacks from the Execute
Window or externally triggered are affected by rate changes.

==== Tap to time

It is possible to change the chase speed or FX speed using Tap to Time.
Holding the S button of the playback and then pressing soft button Y
(2nd soft button up on right side of touch screen).

If the current step in the Cue Stack is set to Chase Timing then the
Chase speed will be modified. If the step is set to Cue Timing then the
FX speed of any FX in the current Cue will be modified.

If a Cue Stack is set to Chase Timing then the GO button can also be
used to tap the time. Note that this only works on chases when the
option “Go Jumps Out of Loop” is set to “No”.

It is also possible to configure the S buttons or the GO buttons to
perform Tap to Time – Setup, View Settings, Playbacks, Tap to time
buttons.

Tap to Time can also be triggered from <<_automation,Autom>> events.

The <<_remote_input_port,remote input>> can also be set to always tap to time the currently selected playback.

=== Playbacks Window

The Playbacks Window enables management of all 202 playbacks regardless
of how many physical wings are attached. This ensures that shows that
will be run on consoles with wings can be programmed on a MagicQ system without wings.
It also provides an ideal way of expanding your show control by
using virtual playbacks.

The Playbacks Window displays a button for each of the 202 playbacks -
starting with the 10 main playbacks and then with 8 wings each with 24
playbacks.

The top right encoder is used to select which Page of playbacks is
displayed. This is completely separate from the Page used for the
physical playbacks - you can have the physical playbacks set to one
page whilst you view and modify playbacks on a different page.

Cues can be recorded onto any of the playbacks in the same way as they
are recorded onto a real playback. After pressing RECORD, instead of
selecting a playback SELECT button, just press the appropriate button in
the Playbacks Window.


==== Testing playbacks

Any playback can be tested, by pressing the button in the Playbacks Window. This has the same effect as raising the physical fader
from zero to full. Pressing the button again sets the fader back to
zero. We will refer to this as a virtual playback.

You can use physical playbacks and virtual playbacks simultaneously -
however if you activate a virtual playback for an active physical
playback then the result will depend on whether the physical playback
and the virtual playback are on the same page. If they are, then the
effect will be that the playback will be activated and set to the
highest level of the physical playback and the virtual playback. If not,
then the physical playback will not be affected and the virtual playback
will be ignored. This is because only one Cue Stack can be run on a
playback.

Use the View Faders soft button to change the view in the Playbacks
Window into faders rather than buttons. Faders can then be moved up and
down using the touch screen / mouse. This enables full control of
virtual playbacks. The GO, PAUSE and RELEASE soft buttons enable
immediate control of virtual playbacks.

You can select a virtual playback as the currently selected playback by
pressing the SELECT button and then pressing the required virtual
playback in the Playbacks Window. This enables the Cue Stack from the
virtual playback to be controlled, including the modification of Cues
and Cue Stack parameters.

In the Playback Window there is a soft button to release all test Cues,
Cue Stacks and Playbacks. This does not release Playbacks that have been
activated been real faders or buttons. This function is also available
on the short cut CTRL + RELEASE.

==== Naming playbacks

Playbacks can be named in the Playbacks Window as per naming of any
Windows item.


==== Copying and moving playbacks

Playbacks can be moved and copied in the Playbacks Window just like any
Window item. You can also change the Playback Window page between
selecting the source and destination, so that you can copy or move
between pages.

When a Playback is copied to another Playback, the Cue Stack on the
source playback is copied (i.e. a new Cue Stack is generated) to the
destination Playback. By default, the Cues that make up the Cue Stack
are not copied - both Cue Stacks reference the same Cues. This means,
for example, that you can generate several copies of a chase, each with
the same Cues but with different chase speeds.

You can force an unlinked copy of Cue Stacks by holding SHIFT down when
you press the COPY button. This forces both the Cue Stack and its Cues
to be copied.


==== Removing playbacks

Playbacks can be removed in the Playbacks Window as per removing of any
Windows item.


==== Playback Rate

It is possible to set the playback rate of a Playback using Encoder X in
the Playback Window. Press the S button of the required playback to
choose which playback to change.

By default the playback rate is locked to 100%. Press the X soft button
to enable changes to playback rates. The playback rate % is shown for
each of the main playbacks when the % is other than 100%.

The playback rate is stored in the show file, so that the rate will
persist over resets and power downs.

Global playback rate can be set using the Y soft button in a similar
way.


=== Wing Playbacks Pages

Playbak wings support 24 playbacks divided into two rows of 12 playbacks.
Each row of playbacks has separate NEXT PAGE and PREV PAGE buttons.

This is a very powerful feature as it allows the playbacks to be split
into separate sections without forcing all the playbacks to be on the
same page.

This provides significant flexibility to how shows are played back – for
example one section of a wing can be used to control traditional lamps whilst
another could be used to control intelligent heads. Changing the Page of
the par lamps would not change the Page of the heads.

By default the page buttons on the main section affect all playbacks
whilst the buttons on each wing row only affect that row. If you plan to
operate a wing section separately then you can avoid the main page
buttons affecting that wing section. In the Setup Window, select VIEW
SYSTEM, VIEW WINGS.

For each wing section you can specify which page buttons the section is
tied to. To operate a section independently of any other page buttons
set the tie to be itself. For example, to operate the upper section of
Wing 1 independently set the upper bank tie to Wing 1 upper.

You can also tie multiple wing banks together to use one set of page
buttons. Thus if you want both sections of a wing to operate off 1 set
of buttons, then you can configure the ties to do this.

When any NEXT PAGE or PREV PAGE buttons are pressed the LCD displays
temporarily change to indicate the current page number.

You can jump to a Wing Playback Page by entering a page number, then
holding the Wing NEXT PAGE button and pressing the Wing PREV PAGE
button.


=== Default Cue Stacks

Cue Stacks can be made to appear on all pages of a Playback. To use this
feature, record a Cue Stack on Page 1 and then in the Playbacks Window
set "Default Cue Stack" to "On" for the selected Playback.

The Cue Stack on Page 1 then appears on any Pages which do not have a
Cue Stack assigned.


=== Synchronising Playbacks

It is possible to sychronise the Cue Stacks on two or more Playbacks.
Set the “Sync next playback to this one” option. MagicQ matches the Cue
Ids in the Cue Stack so it is possible to have different numbers of Cues
in the Stacks. If there is no Cue Id matching in the next Cue Stack then
it will remain at the current Cue.

It is possible to have several Playbacks synced to one master Playback
by setting the option “Sync next playback to this one” on the master and
each adjacent Cue Stack, except for the last one in the chain. MagicQ
tries to match the Cue Id within each Cue Stack to the master Cue Stack.


=== Set lists

It is possible to save and load set lists in the Page Window. Set lists
are simply text files with a list of page names. When the set list is
loaded, MagicQ rearranges the pages so that they are in the order
specified in the set list. Pages that are not specified in the set list
(for example songs not being used today) are moved after all the pages
specified in the set list file.

To use set lists, first name all the pages in the Page Window according
to the song name or section name. You can then save this as a set list
by pressing the Save Set List soft button – the file is saved into the
show folder with a .txt file extension. You can edit this file with a
text editor (e.g. Windows Notepad) to rearrange the songs. Load the set
list back into MagicQ using the Load Set List soft button.
