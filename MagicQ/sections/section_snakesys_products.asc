|===

=== SnakeSys Philosophy

SnakeSys network products enable DMX data, media data and control data to be distributed throughout the lighting rig from control consoles to fixtures.  SnakeSys products can be used with any lighting console or media server - they are independent of MagicQ products.

SnakeSys products are designed and manufactured in the UK using quality electronic components, and are designed for reliability. Wherever possible, all components are mounted on a single circuit board to avoid the need for interconnecting cables. SnakeSys products are designed at a "chip" level, rather than repackaging IT products.

SnakeSys products use professional locking Neutrik Ethercon connectors for all network connections, this avoiding the limited lifetime associated with traditional RJ45 network plugs and sockets.

SnakeSys products use professional locking Neutrik Powercon connectors for power input, ensuring a reliable power input. All SnakeSys products accept voltages from 90V to 250V AC without needing any changes.

Where appropriate, SnakeSys products have in-built battery backup to protect against unexpected power loss.

SnakeSys products support Power over Ethernet - the SnakeSys B4 and T2 can both be powered directly from the R4 rack nodes and switches using Power over Ethernet rather than from the mains - this reduces the number of cables in the system.

SnakeSys products support firmware updates over the network, enabling the products to be easily upgraded to support new features.


=== Networking

SnakeSys products support Art-Net I, Art-Net II and Art-Net III, along with ACN Streaming DMX network protocols. The DMX512 ports are fully configurable with DMX packet length, framing rate, and timings.

All SnakeSys products ship with a 2.X.X.X IP address and 255.0.0.0 Subnet Mask as standard. It is important that any consoles, PCs or Macs that will be communicating with SnakeSys products are set within this IP address range.  SnakeSys products have inbuilt Ethernet switches with auto MDI/MDIX detection, so when connecting directly between a PC/Console and SnakeSys products a cross over Ethernet cable is not required. 

If you change the IP address of the SnakeSys product it will not show up again in Net Manager until you have reconfigured the network on your system to be within the same range as the Interface.

All SnakeSys productsunlock MagicQ PC/Mac Software from Demo mode when connected over network regardless of the mode set up on the SnakeSys product, allowing access to the restricted features of MagicQ.

SnakeSys products with USB ports are for initial factory programming and should not be connected under normal use. 


== SnakeSys B4

The SnakeSys B4 is a four universe DMX to Ethernet convertor. It supports four DMX512 ports that are configurable as either inputs or outputs and one DMX port that is always assigned as an input. The SnakeSys B4 is designed as a multi purpose box to be used in places where a small portable Ethernet to DMX conversion solution is required.

* Universal Ethernet to DMX Interface
* Four DMX512 Ports (configurable as input or output)
* One dedicated DMX512 input port
* Art-Net and ACN Streaming DMX support
* Can be used with any Art-Net or ACN compliant console
* Universe selectable by rotary switches
* ChamNet remote configuration
* Stand-alone DMX buffer mode
* Can be powered by Power over Ethernet

Multiple SnakeSys B4s can be used on a single network, either configured directly from the unit or by using ChamNet control from a MagicQ console. Multiple SnakeSys B4s can be syncronised together to ensure that the DMX output from the console is consistent and does not involve "tearing" either within universes or across multiple universes.

=== Product Diagram

image:images/b4connections.png[image]

For simple Art-Net or ACN to DMX output conversion on the SnakeSys B4 the DIP switches/rotatory encoders can be used to quickly configure the device for this mode.

=== Art-Net Output

On the DMX output end of the B4, the DIP switches are used to configure the device mode. For Art-Net to DMX output mode DIP Switch 4 (switch nearest Socket 1) should be up and all other DIP switches should be in the down position. 

image:images/b4modeswitchartnet.png[image]

The rotary encoders on the reverse side of the unit are used to configure the Art-net Subnet and Universe.
In this mode universes following sequentially, so for example when set to 0-0 the 4 DMX output ports would map to Subnet 0, Universes 0, 1, 2, 3 respectively. 
The LEDs next to the DMX output sockets will light in Blue when the DMX port is active and the unit is outputing DMX.

image:images/b4rotaryswitch.png[image]

=== Art-Net Output + DMX Input

This mode is exactly the same as Art-Net Output except that the DMX Input connector on the rear of the unit is enabled, DIP Switch 2 is used to enable the rear DMX Input. 

image:images/b4modeswitchartnet_plus_in.png[image]

The Input Art-Net Universe follows after the 4 Output Universes, so for example when the rotary encoders are set to 0-0 the 4 DMX Output Ports would map to Subnet 0, Universes 0, 1, 2, 3 and the DMX Input would generate Art-Net Universe 4.

The DMX Input LED will illuminate when the B4 is receiving DMX.

=== ACN Output

On the DMX output end of the B4, the DIP switches are used to configure the device mode. 
For ACN to DMX output mode DIP Switch 3 should be up and all other DIP switches should be in the down position. 

image:images/b4modeswitchacn.png[image]

The rotary encoders on the reverse side of the unit are used to configure the ACN Universes. With the left hand encoder setting the ten value and the right encoder setting the unit value.

image:images/b4rotaryswitch.png[image]

In this mode universes following sequentially, so for example when set to 0-1 the 4 DMX output ports would map to ACN Universes  1, 2, 3, 4 respectively.
The LEDs next to the DMX output sockets will light in Blue when the DMX port is active and the unit is outputing DMX.

=== ACN Output + DMX Input

This mode is exactly the same as ACN Output except that the DMX Input connector on the rear of the unit is enabled, DIP switch 2 is used to enable the rear DMX Input.

image:images/b4modeswitchacn_plus_in.png[image]

The Input ACN Universe follows after the 4 Output Universes, so for example when the rotary encoders are set to 0-1 the 4 DMX Output Ports would map to ACN Universes 1, 2, 3, 4 respectively, and the ACN Input Universe will be ACN Universe 5.

The DMX Input LED will illuminate when the B4 is receiving DMX.

=== Same Universe Output

When the B4 is operating in either Art-Net or ACN mode the DIP Switch Position 1 can be used to optionally enable all 4 DMX Outputs to output the same universe, i.e. the first universe selected by the Rotary Encoders. The B4 will output the same universe when DIP Switch Position 1 is in the UP position.

In the case where the DMX Input feature is also enabled, the DMX Input will generate DMX Output Universe + 1.

=== ChamNet Mode

Running the B4 in ChamNet Mode allows the device to be custom configured. In this mode MagicQ can be used configure each port individually, set DMX timing and refresh rates along with setting the units IP Address and Subnet Mask. The unit can also be firmware upgraded using MagicQ when in ChamNet mode.
On the DMX output end of the B4, the dip switches are used to configure the device mode. 

For ChamNet Mode all DIP switches should be in the down position.

image:images/b4modeswitchchamnet.png[image]

When the unit is in ChamNet mode the rotary encoders are used to set the units MagicQ box id. This is only useful if you have more than one SnakeSys product attached to the network, as each SnakeSys product should have its own unique ChamNet address. If you only have one SnakeSys device attached you can safely leave the rotary encoders both set to zero.

image:images/b4rotaryswitch.png[image]

The Unit can be accessed within MagicQ under Net Manager, found under Setup > View DMX I/O > Net Manager. 

NOTE: If the unit product version is *B4 MK2 or later* the unit will remember the settings that you make in MagicQ Net Manager. Please allow at least 40 seconds for the unit to store the information into flash memory before removing the power. If the unit is left in MagicQ ChamNet mode it will boot up with the settings that you made previously in Net Manager (MagicQ will not be required to be connected to keep the port settings). 
This is a useful work around if you need to pre-configure port settings outside the options that are available through the normal DIP switch settings for use without MagicQ. This save to flash feature is not available on *B4 MK1*.

=== DMX Buffer Mode

The SnakeSys B4 can also be used as a simple DMX buffer, giving 4 DMX outputs from a single DMX input. 

For DMX buffer Mode DIP switch 1 should be in the up position with all other DIP switches down.

image:images/b4modeswitchbuffer.png[image]

==== Rotary Encoder Function, DMX Buffer Mode

The rotary encoders when the unit is operating in DMX buffer mode allow some adjustments to the DMX output protocol, including DMX packet rate, DMX packet length, DMX break length and overall DMX frame timing.

NOTE: These are advanced options, if you do not fully understand what the DMX packet timings actually adjust with regards to the DMX output, or you would just like the default setting you should set both encoders to 0 when using DMX buffer mode.

image:images/b4rotaryswitch.png[image]

NOTE: A version of the tables below is also written on the base of the B4 unit for quick reference in the field.

.Packet Rate and Length [Left Encoder]:
[ options = "header"]
|===================
| Num Channels | Rate 40Hz | Rate 33Hz | Rate 25Hz
| 512 | 0 | 1 | 2
| 256 | 3 | 4 | 5
| 128 | 6 | 7 | 8
| 64 | | | 9
|===================

*Some examples using the above table:*

* Setting position 2 on the *Left Encoder* will give 512 DMX output channels at a 25Hz update rate.

* Setting position 6 on the *Left Encoder* will give 128 DMX output channels at a 40Hz update rate.

.Frame Timing [Right Encoder]:
[ options = "header"]
|===================
| Break (uS) | Frame 48uS | Frame 56us | Frame 64uS
| 92 | 0 | 1 | 2
| 176 | 3 | 4 | 5
| 256 | 6 | 7 | 8
| 384 | 9 | |
|===================

*Some examples using the above table:*

* Setting position 3 on the Right Encoder will give DMX break of 176uS and the frame data bytes will take 48uS

* Setting position 8 on the Right Encoder will give DMX break of 256uS and the frame data bytes will take 64uS

=== DMX Connectors

==== DMX Output Connectors

The four DMX Output connectors are bi-directional and can be configured either as DMX Output or DMX Input however they can only be set as Inputs when the unit is used in ChamNet mode through the Net Manager. When using any DMX Output channel as a DMX Input a male to male 5 pin gender adaptor or equivalent cable may be required.

==== DMX Input Connector

The DMX Input connector on the rear of the unit can only be used as an Input. The DMX Input connector when enabled can be used in Art-Net, ACN and ChamNet mode.

=== Powering the SnakeSys B4

The B4 can be powered either by the mains Powercon Input socket or via PoE (Power over Ethernet) from a compatible device such as the SnakeSys R4, when running via PoE the B4 accepts between 37-57V and takes 6.5-12.9W.

The mains power supply is universal wide input range type and has the following specification: *85 to 264VAC @ 47 to 63 Hz* or *120 to 370VDC*  

The SnakeSys B4 does not have an internal battery.

== SnakeSys R4

The SnakeSys R4 is a multi-purpose network distribution node, comprising DMX output ports, DMX input ports and multiple network ports in a 1U rack.

The SnakeSys R4 is designed to be used on stage for Ethernet to DMX conversion, at front of house for DMX to Ethernet conversaion, and in any other location that requires conversion between DMX and Ethernet or Ethernet switching.

Using one SnakeSys R4 at front of house and one SnakeSys R4 at stage interconnected by a single CAT 5 network cable, the system provides four DMX lines and three independant network lines all over one cable.

The SnakeSys R4 is a 1U rack featuring:

* Powercon input
* Battery backup
* Three Ethercon network connections on front (all can supply Power over Ethernet)
* Two Ethercon network connections on rear
* Four 5-pin DMX output sockets on the front
* Four 5-pin DMX input sockets on the rear
* Full break detect on all four DMX inputs
* Two remote contact inputs
* Relays to automatically connect inputs to outputs in the event of a power failure 


=== Product Diagram

image:images/r4_front_diagram.png["image"]

=== Network Buttons

* *CHAMNET*

Enables ChamNet mode for use with MagicQ console, or disables ChamNet mode where local control mode will be used instead.


* *VPN*

Enables *VPN* (VLAN) mode, which is used to connect two R4 units together and create a virtual private network. Connect a network cable between *NET4* on both units and enable the VLAN with the *VPN* button and the LED will illuminate. *NET1*, *NET2* and *NET3* and *NET5* will each become a separate *VPN* on both units.

.VPN (VLAN) Connectivity:
[ options = "header"]
|====================
| Unit #1 NET Port | Unit #2 NET Port | Connection
| NET1             | NET1 | Virtual LAN (Port to Port)
| NET2             | NET2 | Virtual LAN (Port to Port)
| NET3             | NET3 | Virtual LAN (Port to Port)
| NET5             | NET5 | Virtual LAN (Port to Port)
|====================

NOTE: Each of the network connectors will behave as separate networks.

When in *VPN* Mode, *NET5* is still linked to the processor on each of the R4 units. Using *NET5* on either one of the two units will allow both of the units to be accessed.

=== DMX Mode Buttons

* *IN / OUT*

When the unit is not in ChamNet mode this button can be used to configure the unit as DMX input (on the rear connectors) or DMX output (on the front connectors).

* *ART / ACN*

When the unit is not in ChamNet mode this button can be used to configure the unit as sending or receiving Art-Net or streaming ACN.

* *RDM FILTER* 

At present this button has no function - this will be included in a future firmware update.

=== Selection Buttons

* *DMX*

When the unit is configured as DMX OUT then the DMX button causes the unit to ignore incoming DMX network packets and freeze the DMX output. When the unit is configured as DMX input the DMX button will prevent DMX network packets from being placed onto the network.

* *NET1, NET2, NET3*

These three network buttons disable the packet forwarding on each of the front three network sockets *NETWORK 1*, *NETWORK 2*, *NETWORK 3* respectively. This disables the socket but keeps the link active, and allows for selection of console via the front-panel of the unit. These buttons still work as expected if the unit is operating in *VPN* mode. These buttons do not affect Power over Ethernet (PoE) output.

=== Bypass Buttons

* *ON*

When the bypass is enabled the unit links the 4 DMX inputs on the back to the 4 DMX outputs on the front, so *DMX1* links to *DMX1*, *DMX2* links to *DMX2* etc. This bypasses the entire unit and can be used to allow the DMX inputs to take control of the show. When the unit is fully powered off, the bypass relays will automatically activate.

* *OFF*

This disables the bypass when the unit is powered up and puts the unit into normal operation mode.

=== Address Switches

The leftmost address switch controls tens the rightmost address switch controls units.

Address Switches (ChamNet mode)
When the unit is placed into ChamNet mode the address switches control the unique identifier for the unit, this will appear in MagicQ in the NET MANAGER when the unit is detected. 

Address Switches (Art-Net mode)
When the unit is placed into Art-Net mode the address switches control the Art-Net universe.

Address Switches (sACN mode)
When the unit is placed into sACN mode the address switches control the ACN universe. 

Please note that the first available ACN universe is 1 so switch setting 0 - 0 should not be used in ACN mode.

=== Power Button

* *POWER*

The *POWER* button is used to shut down (when on battery power) or place the unit in standby (when on mains power). Since the unit has an internal UPS when the unit is in standby it will still charge the battery. It is normal that the fan continues to run in standby mode. 

When the power LED flashes it means that the unit has detected the loss of mains power and it is running on battery back-up. Depending on the load conditions regarding Power over Ethernet on the front three network ports, the unit should run for approximately 30 to 40 minutes on battery. When the unit is running off battery back-up it monitors the network link status and DMX inputs and will auto shut off if there is no activity after a predetermined period of time.  The feature prevents the battery from being depleted should the power be removed when the show shuts down.

=== Clear Settings Feature

The R4 has a feature to enable all settings to be reset to factory default.
The procedure to clear the settings is to hold down buttons *NET1*, *NET2* and *NET3* simultaneously and also while keeping the net buttons held down then press and hold the ChamNet button. The R4 will then reboot and factory default settings will be restored. 

=== Special Mode Feature

NOTE: This is a newer feature, please ensure firmware version >= v210 is installed.

Holding down the *DMX* button for 5 seconds will cause R4 to enter special mode selection. One or more of the *NET* buttons can then be used to enable or disable extended DMX feature. During special mode selection the *DMX* button LED will flash.

.Special Mode Table
[options = "header"]
|===================
| Special Mode | LED On | LED Off 
| NET1 | DMX Input uses software based break detect | DMX Input uses hardware based break detect
| NET2 | Future Expansion | Future Expansion
| NET3 | Future Expansion | Future Expansion
|===================	  

Once the required special mode has been selected pressing the *DMX* button again will save the feature to flash and the selected feature will become immediately active. The unit will then return to regular frontpanel function.

=== Power Over Ethernet (PoE)

The SnakeSys R4 contains a fully isolated and standards compliant Power over Ethernet system. PoE output source is available on the front three network sockets by plugging in a PoE compliant network device.

=== Rear Panel Diagram

image:images/r4_rear_diagram.png["image"]

The two *NET* ports on the back of the device do not have PoE (Power over Ethernet) functionality. Both ports can be of general use, and *NET4* can also be used as the *VPN* link between two R4 units.  

=== RDM Support

The R4 hardware supports full RDM functionality, however RDM is not currently supported in R4 firmware.

=== ChamNet Mode Information

In ChamNet Mode, the SnakeSys R4 is configured and controlled from the Net Manager within MagicQ.

NOTE: The R4 unit will remember the settings that you make in MagicQ Net Manager. If the unit is left in MagicQ ChamNet mode it will boot up with the settings that you made previously in Net Manager. (MagicQ will not be required to be connected via network to retain the settings). 

=== Powering the SnakeSys R4

SnakeSys R4 is powered using the supplied Powercon cable.

The power supply is universal wide range input type and has the following specification: *85 to 264VAC @ 47 to 63Hz*

CAUTION: During usage please ensure that the unit has adequate ventilation and that the cooling grilles on the unit are not obstructed.

==== Thermal Management

The SnakeSys R4 contains its own thermal management system. The fan is automatically controlled for regulation of the internal temperature of the unit.

==== Battery Care Information

The inbuilt UPS feature of the SnakeSys R4 is powered by a Battery. If planning to place the unit into long term storage it is recommended to first re-charge the battery by leaving the unit on mains power for at least 2 hours. Storing a unit with a low battery level for a number of months without periodic use can dramatically reduce the operational life of the battery. 

== SnakeSys T2

The SnakeSys T2 is a rugged truss mountable two universe Ethernet to DMX convertor with an in-built network switch supporting three separate DMX output sockets per universe.

* Two universes
* Three 5-pin DMX output sockets per universe
* Four network ports
* Can be powered by Power over Ethernet
* Can be used with any Art-Net or ACN compliant console
* LCD display and buttons for configuration
* RDM capability (subject to firmware development)
* Serial port connecter - e.g for connecting projectors
* Hook clamp fixable in three different orientations
* Omega clamp fixable in four different orientations
* Can be configured without power (inbuilt battery)


=== Product Diagram

image:images/t2_diagram.png[image]

NOTE: Image shown in diagram is T2 product version MK1

For Simple Art-net or ACN to DMX output conversion the SnakeSys T2 inbuilt menu system can be used to quickly configure the device for the required mode.

The T2 can be powered either by the Powercon Input socket or via PoE (Power over Ethernet) from a compatible device such as the SnakeSys R4, when running via PoE the B4 accepts between 37-57V and 6.5-12.9W.
  
The T2 has an internal battery for configuring the unit without the need for connecting to a power source.  The battery is used for addressing and setup of the unit only. 

If running it battery mode and not connected to a power source press the menu button once to power on. 

=== DMX Connectors

The SnakeSys T2 has a total of six DMX Output connectors. The DMX Output connectors are arranged in two rows of three.
When operating in Art-Net or ACN mode the top row of DMX connectors output the first universe that the unit is addressed to, and the second row of DMX connectors output the current universe address + 1. All DMX Outputs are Opto-Isolated, even though each group of three output the same universe. 

NOTE: The SnakeSys T2 MK2 includes an additional DMX Input connector, which is used to provide a DMX Buffer feature and additional DMX Input option for Art-Net and ACN modes.

NOTE: The additional DMX Input connector on the T2 MK2 is not currently supported in MagicQ ChamNet mode.

=== Network Connectors

The SnakeSys T2 has a total of 4 Ethernet Network connectors. The function of these connectors is identical, and they are connected to the same network switch, and they can be used for communication with the T2 device and other devices connected to any of the T2 network ports. The PoE network connector located next to the Powercon connector on the base of the unit also has additional power distribution circuitry for powering the T2 via PoE (Power over Ethernet).

Due to the circuit difference with the PoE input connector in some circumstances when the T2 is connected with an incorrectly wired Ethernet cable, the network side of the PoE connector may appear not to function when compared to plugging the incorrectly wired cable into the other network connectors. This is completely normal.

The three network connectors on the front of the unit can have packet forwarding enabled or disabled via the Network Port Menu. In the menu they are referred to as ports A, B and C from top to bottom respectively. 
When default settings are applied, all the connectors have packet forwarding enabled.
 
=== Menu System

The SnakeSys T2 is operated using an in-built menu system. 

The *MENU* button is dual purpose and serves as an enter button as well. 
In all cases the *INC* and *DEC* buttons are used to either increase or decrease values or selections respectively and generally combined with the enter key provide basic menu navigation.

Pressing the *MENU* button from the Top Screen will cause the T2 unit to enter the main menu. If the unit is left navigating one of the menu's and no buttons are pressed for some time the unit will automatically return to the Top Screen.

When in ChamNet mode any changes applied to each T2 universe will be automatically updated on the Top Screen.

If backlight timeout is not set to infinite then the unit will automatically turn off the backlight after the user set time in the backlight menu if no buttons are pressed.

The top level screen provides immediate information regarding both universes, which includes protocol and address:

=== RDM Support

The T2 hardware supports full RDM functionality, however RDM support does not currently exist in the current version of the T2 firmware. RDM support will be implemented in a future firmware release.

=== ChamNet Mode Information

In ChamNet Mode the SnakeSys T2 is configured and controlled from the Net Manager within MagicQ.

* DATA LED

The red DATA LED on the SnakeSys T2 indicates that valid ChamNet network data is being received by the unit.

* ONLINE LED

The green ONLINE LED on the SnakeSys T2 indicates that the unit has recently sent T2 device information to MagicQ and should have consequently appeared as online in the MagicQ Net Manager.

NOTE: The T2 unit will remember the settings that you make in MagicQ Net Manager. Please allow at least 40 seconds for the unit to store the information into flash memory before removing the power. If the unit is left in MagicQ ChamNet mode it will boot up with the settings that you made previously in Net Manager. (MagicQ will not be required to be connected via network to retain the settings). 

=== T2 Truss Mounting

.Safety Note

CAUTION: If the T2 unit is installed into Truss using clamps then additional care should always be taken to ensure that the unit is installed with an adequate safety chain firmly attached through the T2 rear chassis. Care should also be taken to ensure that the units clamp is securely fastened to the Truss, and only T2 clamp mounts supplied by ChamSys Ltd are recommended.

=== Powering the SnakeSys T2

There are three methods in which the SnakeSys T2 can be powered:

|===
|Mains supply via Powercon connector on the base of the unit | The power supply is universal wide range input type and has the following 	specification: *85 to 264VAC @ 47 to 63 Hz* or *120 to 370VDC*	
|PoE (Power over Ethernet) | Using the network connector located next to the Powercon connector on the base of the unit. 
|Battery | Pressing the "Menu" button when no power is supplied to the unit will cause the T2 to enter "Battery Mode".  When in battery mode the address and mode of operation can be set via the menu. 	This is a useful feature as the unit can be addressed and configured without the presence of any stage power.  When in battery mode the unit will automatically turn off after 1 minute of 	inactivity. DMX and Network operations are not available in battery mode.
|===

NOTE: It is possible to connect up both Mains and PoE supplies at the same time which provides some fail safe redundancy should one of the supplies fail for some reason.

=== DMX Connectors

The DMX connectors are bi-directional and can be configured either as DMX Output or DMX Input. When using any channel as DMX Input a male to male 5 pin gender adaptor or equivalent cable may be required.

=== Network Connectors

The SnakeSys R8 has a total of two Ethernet Network connectors. The function of the network connectors are identical, and they are connected to the same network switch, they can be used for communication with the R8 device and additionally other devices connected to the other R8 network port. 

NOTE: Care should be taken to avoid any network loop caused by incorrect network connection in your configuration, one symptom of a network loop is that the R8 will be overloaded with excessive network traffic and as a result the main menu will seem unresponsive. If you notice the symptom, please re-check your networking connections and correct accordingly.

=== Menu System

The SnakeSys R8 is operated using an in-built menu system. 

The interface incorporates an encoder, for changing menu item values, which also acts as a push button with enter functionality. There are also *UP* / *DOWN* / *LEFT* and *RIGHT* buttons which can also be used for navigation and change of menu items. 

The top level screen provides some immediate information regarding each of the 8 ports, and also indicates the units base address, protocol, and firmware version.

Pressing the any button or rotating the encoder during display of the Top Screen will cause the R8 unit to enter the main menu. If the unit is left navigating one of the menu's and no button or encoder movement is detected for some time the unit will automatically return to the Top Screen.
When in the R8 is in ChamNet mode the protocol or direction changes applied to each R8 port will be automatically updated on the Top Screen.

| Menu Item | Function
| ArtNet IP 1 | Used to set the main R8 network IP address used by the R8 processor. If the unit is placed into Art-Net mode then this IP is used for Art-Poll-Reply / Art-Net DMX network data on ports 1 through 4.  The main IP address is automatically chosen when the R8 units default settings are 	applied, however sometimes it is necessary to change the address.  This is an advanced option.
| ArtNet IP 2 | Secondary IP address used only in Art-Net mode for Art-Poll-Reply / Art-Net.  DMX network data on ports 5 through 8.  The secondary IP address is automatically chosen when the R8 units default settings are applied, however sometimes it is necessary to change the address.  This is an advanced option.
| Subnet Mask | This is an advanced option, The default subnet mask is normally 255.0.0.0
