== FX Editor
MagicQ includes a FX editor added to enable users to create their own
waveform FX and to edit existing waveform FX. The FX editor edits the
core MagicQ waveform FX stored on the console – distinct from the
combination FX stored in the FX Window. Waveform FX are not specific to
a particular personality type – they can be used on any Head with the
required attributes.

Changes made in the FX editor have immediate effect on all Cues that use
the FX – for example changing the standard circle FX will affect all
cues with circle. It also affects the FX stored on the console, so all
changes will affect new shows made on the console.

MagicQ will not allow you to directly edit the inbuilt FX – you must
SAVE AS to create a new FX before you make any changes in the FX Editor.

From v1.4.0.3 MagicQ FX supports any number of attributes in a Waveform
FX –previous versions supported a maximum of 3 different attributes.
Note that shows that use Waveform FX with more than 3 attributes will
not run correctly on software prior to v1.4.0.3.

A MagicQ FX can store data for more than 1 head – so that for instance,
you can make a FX with some heads perform circles in whilst others
perform squares.

In the FX Editor Window (FX Window, Edit FX) it is now possible to
extract the user FX from a show file to the console. Press the EXTRACT
USER FX soft button.

It is possible to remove all user Waveform FX from a console. Press
SHIFT + REMOVE USER FX.


=== View General

In View General you can configure properties for the FX. For FX that
only use 1 attribute setting the “Apply to any attribute” enables the FX
to be used on any attribute rather than being tied to a specific
attribute such as dimmer.

Defaults can be set up for speed, size, spread and contrast. Setting
contrast to snap forces the contrast for the FX to default to 0 – i.e.
snap rather than fade. The contrast of a FX can be changed at any time
during programming or playback.

The add mode determines the default for how the FX is added to the base
values – the choices are NORMAL, PLUS, MINUS or ABS. When set to ABS,
playbacks will ignore any base values for the channels and treat the FX
values as absolute values – this is useful for generating FX based on
absolute positions or on specific colours on a colour wheel.


=== View Chans

Each step in the FX consists of a value between 0 and 255 and a curve.
The curve specifies how the level changes from one step to the next. The
valid curves are:

0 – proportional fade
1 – sine fade
2 – cosine fade
3 – snap

The waveform for the complete FX is shown at the top. Moving up and down
with the cursor to a different attribute or head shows the waveform for
that attribute / head.

FX that have been recorded in a show, but that have not been stored onto
the console can be extracted from the show by including the Cue that
uses the FX. This will bring the FX into the FX Editor, and it can then
be saved on the console.


=== Palette FX

In the FX Editor in View General, set up “Use Palettes” to be either
“Pos”, “Col” or “Beam”. Then in View Chans, the values become Palette
entries rather than absolute values.

Each step in the Waveform FX can use any of the first 256 Palettes.

When applying a Palette FX if a Palette does not contain the specified
attribute for a selected head then it will use the attribute from the
first head in the Palette with that attribute.
