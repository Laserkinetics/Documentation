== LED & Pixel Mapping
MagicQ utilises a powerful Cue engine, which enables it to easily handle
large numbers of LED heads in the form of panels, battens and moving
lights. MagicQ's ability to handle large numbers of heads independently
ensures that Lighting Designers get to make the most of their LED arrays
without being limited by the console. With MagicQ you can generate
complete rainbow washes across all LED fixtures at the touch of a button
with immediate live control during playback through encoders and
buttons.

MagicQ includes a powerful Pixel Mapper designed for use
with arrays of LED fixtures. You can design a grid structure based on
the layout of the fixtures on the stage and then play back movies,
bitmaps and text messages on that grid. The grid can have spaces in it
allowing the fixtures to be spread over the grid as they appear on the
stage.

image:images/pixelmapchamsys.png[image]

MagicQ enables LED fixtures to be used in their "high resolution" mode
enabling individual control of each LED pixel rather than the restricted
modes where Lighting Designers are reliant on the same old in built
effects that everyone has seen many times.

=== Patching LED on MagicQ

We recommend that you patch LED fixtures in their highest resolution mode (maximum number of controllable RGB elements) and chose a mode without extra inbuilt FX channels if possible.

The generic led3chan and generic led4chan can be used with most LED
fixtures. If MagicQ does not have the required personality in its
library then you can easily build your own personality using the
in-built Head Editor.

For LED heads without dimmers we recommend you patch the RGB channels as HTP.  For LED fixtures with an inbuilt dimmer channel the RGB channels should be LTP.

After patching your LED heads you should set up the head numbers for
each fixture in the Patch Window. By default MagicQ numbers heads in the
order they are patched starting at 0. Simply edit the head number field
in the Patch Window to change the head numbers. Use SHIFT and the
cursors keys to set multiple head numbers.

=== Using the Grid view in the Outputs Window

To make the most of your LED head you can create a grid containing
the LED head and then each head becomes a “pixel” in the grid.
The MagicQ Pixel Mapper can then be used to play back movies,
bitmaps and text on the grid.

In the example above, we patched a 20 by 20 matrix of RGB pixels (total
400 pixels) on Universes 4.5 and 6.

Then in the Outputs Window, Plan View create a grid. First set up the
grid size, by pressing the GRID SIZE soft button. Enter the horizontal
size followed by the vertical size – e.g. 20/20.

In the Plan View there are three different views, Head Names, Colours
and Head Numbers. Press Head Numbers and View Grid to see the grid. 

=== Inserting heads into the grid

You can enter the head numbers in the grid according to the layout of
the LED fixtures within the matrix / stage. Put the cursor on the desired item and enter a head number on the keypad.  To insert multiple head numbers in one go use SHIFT or CTRL and the cursor
keys to set multiple head numbers in one go before entering the starting head number.

To set multiple items in a particular orientation then put the cursor on the starting item then move in the direction you wish them to number - for example to number from bottom right to top left going horizontally first, then put the cursor on the bottom right, press SHIFT and move left to the left corner and then up to the top left corner.


image:images/outputsplannumber.png[image]

To insert the currently selected heads into the grid use the INSERT HEADS soft button.  Choose between horizontally or vertically.  If no heads are currently selected then all patched heads will be inserted.

Note that it is not necessary to allocate a head number to every position
in the grid – so if your LED fixtures are placed at weird angles you can
make a grid with the LED placed as you would see it. Multiple grids can
contain the same head numbers – so it is possible to have one grid with
the LED tightly packed and anther representing how they are really
spaced out.

image:images/outputsplaninsert.png[image]

Once the grid is configured you can then see the Output by pressing the
View Colours soft button and the View Grid soft button. For instance,
below you can see the Output when all 400 heads were selected from the
Group window (using the All LED3chan group) and then a RGB FX was played
back on them.

You can test the head selected in the grid using the test mode to the
Grid selected via soft button C. In test mode the head under the cursor
is tested (located). This enables the grid layout to be easily checked.


=== Pixel Mapper

MagicQ software contains an in-built Pixel Mapper that appears as a
media server just like an external media server. The Pixel Mapper can be
used to play back images, movies, text and FX on a grid of LED, dimmers
or moving lights.

If the heads in the grid have colour mixing then the pixel mapping will
operate on the RGB (or CMY). If they have no colour mix then the
pixel mapping will operate on the Colour Wheel or if there is no colour
wheel, then on the intensity. The pixel mapping can be set to always
operate on the intensity regardless of head type.


When the Pixel Mapper is patched for a grid then MagicQ sets up
the media settings automatically so that the Pixel Mapper appears in the
Media Window.

Once a grid has been designed in the Plan View of the Outputs Window,
then pressing the PATCH PIXMAP soft button automatically patches the
internal pixel mapper (personality generic bitmapfx2).

image:images/mediawindowpixelmap.png[image]

MagicQ asks the user to specify the number of layers required and will
patch that number of layers (generic bitmapfx2 heads). The layers will
be named according to the grid that is selected in the Outputs Window.
MagicQ uses head numbers above the other patched fixtures

When operating on a layer within the pixel mapper it will default to
operating on the grid that was selected when it was patched. MagicQ overrides the default value for Grid Number specified in the Head Editor
for generic bitmapfx2.

MagicQ automatically adds the settings for the Pixel Mapper to the Media
View of the Setup Window. This enables the Pixel Mapper to be accessed
immediately from the Media Window without further set up.


==== Using Bitmaps, Movies, Text and FX on Grids

The bitmaps and text are controlled using bitmap layers – each layer is
controlled like a normal moving light – i.e. it is patched as a virtual
personality - generic bitmapfx2.hed.  The personality has channels
to select the bitmap or text, channels for X, Y position and size,
rotate and master levels for red, green and blue. Multiple layers can be
used to mix between the layers using add, subtract, min, max or invert
colour mix modes.

Each bitmap layer uses 40 channels from the output channels. When you
patch the Pixel Mapper from the Grid View, MagicQ chooses free channels
for the layers. These channels are then reserved for the pixel mapper
layers and can not be used for controlling real lights. It is best to
patch generic bitmap layers to unused universes or to set them as unpatched.

The Bitmapfx2 is patched to the encoders as follows

* Intensity Page Intensity

* Position Page: Position, size, rotation of the Bitmap/Text/FX.

* Colour Page: Colour, mixing between layers of the Bitmap/Text/FX

* Media Page (Beam 1): Control of Movies, Bitmaps - internal, user and
gobo icon library, Live Feeds

* Text Page (Beam 2): Control of Text – 2 separate text engines, real time
editing of text string

* FX Page (Beam 3): Control of FX - lines, spots, snakes, rainbows, audio
triggers, circles, squares


==== Media Priority

FX, Text and Media interact according to the following priorities, with
FX having the highest priority and Media the lowest.

FX Page If FX Type is greater than 0 then FX has highest Priority

Text Page If Text 1 is greater than 0 or Text 2 is greater than 0 then
Text has priority over media

Media Page Media has the lowest priority

In the Media Window the Media Page (encoder Y) is used to select the
media that is played on the grid. The Media pages are as follows

.Inbuilt Inbuilt patterns and colours

* Pics 1 User bitmaps (bmp or jpeg)

* Pics 1 User bitmaps (bmp or jpeg)
 
* Pics 1 User bitmaps (bmp or jpeg)

* Pics 1 User bitmaps (bmp or jpeg)

* Movies 1 User movies (cmv – use MagicQ Media centre to convert from
mpeg,avi,mov etc...)

* Movies 2 User movies (cmv – use MagicQ Media centre to convert from
mpeg,avi,mov etc...)

* Movies 3 User movies (cmv – use MagicQ Media centre to convert from
mpeg,avi,mov etc...)

* Movies 4 User movies (cmv – use MagicQ Media centre to convert from
mpeg,avi,mov etc...)

* Timers Date, Time, Up counters, Down counters, end of year counters

* Live Feed Live capture from a PC screen

* Gobos Access to all the gobo, colours and image libraries



==== Inbuilt Bitmaps

The Pixel Mapper contains a library of standard bitmap patterns on Bitmap
Page 0. These patterns are automatically sized to the size of your grid.

Select the Pixel Mapper, Layer 1 and press LOCATE to set the layer to its
defaults.

image:images/pixelmaplocate.png[image]

After a Locate the Media parameters will default to the white cross. Use
the touch screen or encoders to select different Bitmaps.


==== User Picture Support

MagicQ supports picture files in .bmp or .jpeg format and can be loaded
using the LOAD PICTURE soft button.

In addition the user can add their own bitmaps in .bmp or .png format
manually into the Pics Pages 1 to 4. Copy the bitmaps into the bitmaps
folder underneath the show folder. The bitmaps should be named
bitmap001-001.bmp, bitmap001-002.png etc…The first 3 digits are the
bitmap page and the second 3 digits the bitmap within the page. Bitmap
page 0 is reserved for standard, internally generated bitmap patterns.

It is best to make user bitmaps the same size as the output grid. By
default User bitmaps and icons from the internal library are applied to
the grid using their normal size. It is possible to make MagicQ scale
the user bitmaps and internal icons to the size of the grid - use the
Apply Type “Scale to Grid” to resize a bitmap to the full grid size.


==== Gobo / Colour Libraries

Media pages 128 to 255 select the icons from the gobo / colour library.
The icons are all based on 32 by 32 pixels – but they can be sized in
the Position Window to fill the required grid size.


==== Movie support

MagicQ supports playback of movies as well as bitmaps. MagicQ supports
up to 1024 different movie files.

Movies are accessed through the Media Page – there are 4 ranges on the
“Media Page” encoder – Movie 1,Movie 2,Movie 3, Movie 4. These ranges
are after the Inbuilt Page and Pics Pages.

User pictures and movies can be loaded into the internal pixel mapper
directly from the Media Window using the LOAD PIC / LOAD MOVIE soft
button available when the Pixel Mapper server is selected.

Movies are stored in the movies folder (show\movies) in a similar way
that bitmaps are stored in the bitmaps folders. Movie files are stored
in a special ChamSys movie format which compresses the data to the
required grid resolution. The files are named movie001-001.cmv,
movie001-002.cmv, etc...

ChamSys movie files can be created in MagicQ on PC/Mac using Tools, CMV Converter.

When converting movie files we recommend you choose the same movie
resolution as your grid size on MagicQ. Click the auto install feature
to automatically install the converted media file into the movies folder
naming it with the next free movie ID.

The speed of movie playback can be controlled by the movie speed
encoder.


==== Live feed support

The MagicQ Pixel Mapper includes a “Live feed” option for capturing live
feed video signals from Media Servers and external live feed sources. MagicQ supports live feeds from all 50 connected Media Servers (including the inbuilt MagicHD) and up to external 5 different live feed sources.

To use the output of a Media Server in the Pixel Mapper set the Media Folder to Live Feed and choose the Media File Server 1 to Server 50 to choose a feed from the appropriate media server as configured in Setup, View System, View Media.  Feeds from the inbuilt MagicHD are used directly, whilst feeds from external media servers use the live preview capabilities.  Live feed is only available from external Media Servers that support live preview over CITP MSEX.

External live feed sources are captured from the screen of a PC running MagicQ Media centre. MagicQ Media centre then sends the live feed information over the network,
making it available to all consoles on the network.

On MagicQ, select the Pixel Mapper layer and then set the Live Feed
Media Page (value 127) and select 1 to 5 for the 5 live feeds.

In MagicQ Media Centre select Devices, Live Feeds to configure the live
feeds. For each live feed the user can set the position and size of the
capture area on the PC screen. In addition the resolution of the live
feed sent over the network can be configured – generally this should be
set to the same size as the grid being used on the MagicQ
consoles/MagicQ PC systems.

The position and size of screen capture on the MagicQ Media Centre PC
can be remote controlled from a MagicQ system using ArtNet. This allows
different capture areas for the sources to be recorded into the Cues on
MagicQ.

In MagicQ Media Centre select Devices, DMX Devices and select the Type
as “Live Feed Position”. Select the ArtNet Universe and Channel to
respond to. Note that ArtNet Universes start at 0 so if you are using
Universe 1on a MagicQ Console you will most likely need to select ArtNet
Universe 0 Channel 1.

MagicQ Media Centre maps 50 consecutive DMX channels for controlling
Live Feeds – each Live Feed consisting of a simple 10 channel
personality. On MagicQ patch the number of live feeds required using the
Generic Live Feed personality. The channels are

Chan Description Default

1.  Control 0
2.  X coarse 1
3.  X fine 0
4.  Y coarse 1
5.  Y fine 0
6.  Width coarse 0
7.  Width fine 100
8.  Height coarse 0
9.  Height fine 100
10. Spare 0

The values for control are:

1.  No changes
2.  Change Position

128 Change Position and Size

The width and height controlled via remote are the width and height of
the capture area for the live feed. The resolution for the feed (pixel
width and pixel height) is configured on MagicQ Media Centre only.


==== Using text strings

Two text strings can be played back on each layer. The text strings can
be positioned at the top, middle or bottom of the grid and can be made
to scroll in either horizontal or vertical directions. Text strings can
be edited live for real time message applications.

Control text strings from the Text Page (Beam Page 2). Each of the two
text strings has a Text Page, a Text, a Text speed and a Text mode.

Using the Text Page and Text encoders select a string that has not been
programmed – e.g. Text Page 1, Text 0. Type in new text on the keyboard,
press SET and press the soft button associated with the Text attribute.
The Input Display will report “text stored”.

image:images/pixelmaptext.png[image]

The Text mode determines how the text is displayed; horizontally,
vertically, top, bottom or middle. The Text speed determines the speed
that the text scrolls across the screen.

Note that Text mode values less than 128 cause the text to be scrolled
across the screen with no gap between the start and end of the text.
Text mode values greater than 128 cause the text to be scrolled with a
gap between the end of the text and the starting of the text again. Two
different fonts can be selected using the text mode values.

The two sets of text controls enable one text string to be scrolled in
one direction and another text string to be scrolled in the opposite
direction.


==== Text display modes

It is also possible to use the single modes to display a single
character, a single word or a single phrase from the text string at a
time on the screen.

By using the position and size parameters in the Position Window, the
character can be placed anywhere in the grid or made to fill the entire
grid.

image:images/pixelmap1char.png[image]

image:images/pixelmap1charbig.png[image]

When the mode is set to single words then MagicQ displays each word in
turn. Each word must be separated by a single space in the text string.

When the mode is set to chunks single chunks then MagicQ displays each
chunk in turn. Each chunk must be separated by a single underscore (_)
character in the text string. Space characters are displayed normally.


==== Manipulating bitmaps and text

Use the Position attributes of the bitmap layer to make changes to the
position of the bitmap / text – set the X or Y position, the X or Y size
and the rotation.

You can play back standard FX on the bitmap layer attributes just like
you would on a moving head. For example, to scroll a bitmap form left to
right, first set the X position to centre (X pos is 128) and then add a
Ramp Up to the X pos.

Use the Colour attributes to determine the layers of red, green and blue
in the bitmap / text. For LED matrix you may find it is better to use
only one colour at a time – for instance, set Red to 255 and Blue and
Green to 0.

An iris and a strobe function are also included under the Beam
attributes.

It is also possible to use playbacks set as LTP faders in order to
control individual parameters of the bitmap from faders.

==== Pixel Map FX

The FX channels enable FX to be applied to the grid. The FX type selects
the FX that is applied. Some of the FX are stand-alone, e.g. lines and
rainbows. Others like move and audio FX are applied on top of the
selected bitmap or text.

The FX parameters depend upon the FX type selected – but generally FX
parameter 1 is the speed, FX parameter 2 is the offset between row or
column items in the grid, and FX parameter 3 selects the mode – forward,
reverse, bounce or twin.

The currently supported FX are:

Vert lines, Horiz lines – enables lines to be moved across the grid.
Modify the mode to change thickness of the lines. Change offset to make
patterns rather than lines.

The first image below shows vertical lines with parameter 2 and
parameter 3 set to 0. Adjusting parameter 2 gives an offset on the line
as shown in the second image. Adjusting parameter 3 changes the width of
the line and changes the mode to bounce instead of normal in the third
image.

image:images/pixelmapfxline.png[image]

image:images/pixelmapfxzig.png[image]

image:images/pixelmapfxzigzag.png[image]

Vert random, Horiz random – enable random movement of elements across
the grid. Modify the mode to change thickness of the elements and offset
to change the frequency. With this FX it is possible to generate snow
and rain type FX.

image:images/pixelmapfxsnow.png[image]

Spot random – enable random spots on the grid. Modify mode to determine
whether the defaults is white spots on black background or black spots
on white background.

image:images/pixelmapfxrnd.png[image]

Vert Rainbow, Horiz Rainbow – enable rainbow patterns across the grid.
Modify offset to multiply the rainbow across the grid.

image:images/pixelmapfxrainbowlines.png[image]

Snakes – enable snaking patterns on the grid. Modify the mode to
determine the number of snakes, the randomness of the movement and
whether they are white or coloured.

image:images/pixelmapfxrndlines.png[image]

image:images/pixelmapfxrndlinescol.png[image]

Bat’n’Ball – enables simple bat and ball game on the grid. The bats are
controlled by FX Parameters 2 and 3. The game starts when one of the
bats is moved. Other bitmap layers can be combined with this to make a
background for the playing field.

image:images/pixelmapfxbatnball.png[image]

Vert Move, Horiz Move, Move – moves the selected bitmap or text around
the grid. The bitmap will wrap around the edges, thus allowing a texture
to be moved across the entire surface of the grid.

Ramp Horiz and Ramp Vert – these perform a ramp across the entire grid
in the horizontal or vertical directions. FX P1 parameter controls the
speed, FX P2 controls the crossfade and FX P3 controls the width.

Wipe Horiz and Wipe Vert – these perform a wipe of a colour across the
entire grid in the horizontal or vertical directions. The colour wiped
across the grid is determined by the red, green, blue colour attributes
of the Pixel Map layer. It is possible to wipe multiple colours across a
grid simultaneously by choosing different colours in sequence. When
these FX are in use the red, green, blue attributes do not affect the
overall colour of the layer as they would normally.

==== Pixel Map Audio FX

The Pixel Mapper supports Audio FX – it uncovers part of the selected bitmap, text or movie dependent
on the level of the audio input.

image:images/pixelmapsoundtolight.png[image]

Parameter 2 select the channels to respond to. When set to 0, it uses
all 14 audio input channels. From 1 to 14 it selects one channel to
respond to. Value 15 selects the left channels, value 16 the right
channels.

The mode determines from which grid edge the audio takes effect. The
image below shows an audio effect on the internal green, yellow, red
bitmap.

The possible modes are:

|====
|0|Graph top|Graphic equalizer down|FX P2 specifies channels
|1|Level top|Columns left to right|FX P2 specifies channels
|2|Level bottom|Columns right to left|FX P2 specifies channels
|3|Level left|Rows top to bottom|FX P2 specifies channels
|4|Level right|Rows bottom to top|FX P2 specifies channels
|5|BMT1|Split into 3 - Mid,Base,Treble|
|6|BMT2|Split into 3 - Base,Mid,Treble|
|7|BMT3|Split into 3 - Base,Treble,Mid|
|8|BMT4|Split into 3 - Treble,Base,Mid|
|9|BMT5|Split into 3 - Treble,Mid,Base|
|10|BMT6|Split into 3 - Mid,Treble,Base|
|64|Graph bottom|Graphic equalizer up|FX P2 specifies channels
|128|Graph bottom/top|Graphic equalizer up/down|FX P2 specifies channels
|192|Graph top/bottom|Graphic equalizer down/up|FX P2 specifies channels
|====


In Setup, View Settings, Ports, Audio Input select the audio interface. The Audio Max Level defaults to 0 which indicates a full audio
range signal is expected. To boost the audio signal, set the Audio Max Level to the maximum value expected between 1 and 255.  If there is a lot of noise then set the Audio Min Level to eliminate the noise.


==== Mixing between Pixel Mapping layers

The interaction of the different pixel mapping layers can be controlled
using the Col Mix attribute in the colour page. The types are

* Add
* Subtract
* Max
* Min
* Exclusive Or (EOR)
* Priority (higher layer numbers have priority)
* Priority > 0 (priority if level greater than 0)
* Masking
* Mask invert
* Blue key
* Green key
* Multiply
* No base
* Max with base

When a layer is set to “green key” then any green pixels in that layer
pass through the media from the lower layers. Non-green pixels play back
the media on that layer. The mask must be pure green.

When a layer is set to “blue key” then any blue pixels in that layer
pass through the media from the lower layers. Non-blue pixels play back
the media on that layer. The mask must be pure blue.

When any active Pixel Map layer is active (dimmer above 0%) then setting
“no base” on that layer will make the Pixel Map effect ignore any base
level for the controlled channels instead of adding to the base level.

When any active Pixel Map layer is active (dimmer above 0%) then setting
“max with base” on that layer will make MagicQ perform a maximum of the
Pixel Map effect and any base level for the controlled channels instead
of adding to the base level.


==== Colour Mixing

The Colour Page of attributes allows the levels of the red, green and
blue attributes to be set independently. The default values are 128,
128, 128. Each colour can be boosted or cut.

The Colour Type attribute allows the overall colour to be adjusted
including inverts, mapping of colours, black and white and other colour
effects.


==== Apply Type

Added new apply type to the Pixel Mapper of “use int” and “fit use int”.
When these apply types are used the Pixel Mapper applies to the
intensity channel of the fixtures in the grid instead of to the RGB
channels. If the fixtures in the grid have no intensity channel then no
pixel mapping is applied to the fixture. This is useful for example to
use the pixelmapper on the intensity channel of moving lights or on
strobes.

=== 3D Pixel Mapping

==== Configuration

MagicQ supports 3D Pixel Mapping, enabling easy control of LED ceilings, chandeliers and other 3D LED objects.  MagicQ supports 3D grids and multiple fixtures can be inserted into the 3D grid in one go making it easy to create the grid mapping.  

In the Output Window, View Plan a grid can be made into a 3D grid by pressing SHIFT and SET GRID DEPTH.  This makes the current grid into the starting grid and allocates the following grids to make up the depth.  The following grids must be empty (0/0 size) before they can be allocated to a 3D grid.  For example, to make a 10x10x20 grid - go to grid 1, set the grid size to 10x10.  Then set the grid depth to 20.  Grid 1 then becomes a 3D grid using grids 1 to 20. The Grid is shown on Encoder A as grid 1-1 (20) to 1-20 (20).  MagicQ no longer shows grids 2 to 20.

Fixtures can be now be inserted into the grid in 3D direction as well as the normal way - horizontally or vertically. Pressing INSERT HEADS gives a list of options.  When inserting in 3D direction the starting position in 3D is determined by the Grid number.  For example if you have Grid 1 as a 10x10x20 grid then inserting a 5 element multi head fixture into Grid 1-1 using 3D Direction will insert it into grids 1-1 to 1-5. If you do the same operation into Grid 1-10 then it will insert into grids 1-10 to 1-15.

The MagicQ Pixel Mapper personality (Generic_Bitmap_With FX 2.hed) has been extended to add extra channels for controlling 3D FX (Generic_Bitmap_With FX 3.hed). In the Outputs Window, View Plan pressing PATCH PIXMAP will now patch the 3D personality (FX3).


==== Effects

3D Pixelmapping effects are selected using the "3D FX Type" parameter under the "FX" page in the Media window. Extra parameters to the 3D effects can be selected on the 3D FX page. 

There are a selection of available inbuilt 3D effects available in MagicQ which can also take up to two other layers as bitmap parameters.

The order of these layers is processed from left to right in the media window, so when using parameter based effects, you need to apply the parameters in a lower numbered layer to that of the effect.

For the majority of cases, having Layer 1 set to 3D FX Type "Apply 3D FX 1", Layer 2 set to "Apply 3D FX 2" and Layer 3 set to the desired effect will be sufficient.

===== Heightmap
image:images/3d_heightmap.png[image]

This effect takes the input media from it's own layer, and uses the Parameter Layer 1 to offset the vertical position of the layer in 3D space and the Parameter Layer 2 to change the amount of blur. The vertical position and blur are calculated per column, so wave effects can be applied by using the "Organic" 2D FX on the Param 1 layer.

FX A p1 applies a constant height offset to the entire grid on top of the Parameter Layer 1 amount.
FX B p1 applies a constant blur amount to the entire grid on top of the Parameter Layer 2 amount.

image:images/3d_heightmap_blur.png[image]

The "Fill up" and "Fill down" modes fill the rest of the 3D space either above or below the media layer with the same pixel value. 


image:images/3d_heightmap_fillup.png[image]
image:images/3d_heightmap_filldown.png[image]


===== Slide
The slide effect slides the 2D frame and slides it either back or forward in the Z axis over time.

FX A p1 determines the speed and direction of the movement. 0 to 127 being slide up from fast to slow, and 128 to 255 being slide down from fast to slow

===== Particles

The particle FX applies a simple particle system to the 3D grid. The particles take their colour from the Hue/Sat/Brightness colour values in the Col section of the Media window.

FX A p1 determines the direction, axis and speed upon which the 3D particles travel. 

FX A x determines the spawn probability of a particle if one isn't currently alive in the column

===== Particle bounce
The particle bounce effect can be likened to a grid of balls, where changes to the Parameter Layer 1 values are used as a "kick" to the ball upwards.

Using this method, you can use a flash button to flash on the Parameter Layer 1, and the particles will flick up, and then fall back down again under a simulated gravity. Alternatively using the Audio Input to MagicQ, use a bass beat to bump the particles in the grid.

Only when a particle is stationary will it receive a "kick". If the particle is still in mid air, it will continue to fall under the effects of the simulated gravity.

A larger change in value to the input will result in a larger velocity.


=== Multi Element Heads

From v1.5.1.0 it is possible to play back patterns specifically on
multi element heads such as Chromlech Jarags (5x5 dimmers) or other LED
tile squares. If the Pos FX is set to “Mult head” then any media, text
or FX on that layer will apply to the individual multi element heads
rather than across the entire grid. The same “image” will be placed on
all the multi head elements. For best results the grid should be made of
same size fixtures with equal spacing.


=== Making Grids of Groups

Sometimes it is useful to make a grid of groups rather than a grid of
individual heads – for example you may have a large amount of LED broken
down into panels which you have then programmed as groups.

Grids of groups enable multiple heads to be allocated to one box in the
grid. When Bitmaps, Text or internal FX are played back on the grid,
then all heads in a group will take the colour/level associated with a
particular box in the grid.

==== Auto Groups

The auto groups function in the Outputs Window, Plan View has an
option to generate groups for each of the multi head fixtures in the
chosen grid. 

These groups can then be use in a grid of groups to perform
intensity and colour chases across all the multi heads. By using the
first layer for the grid of heads, and the second layer for a grid of
groups with colour mode set to multiply the FX on the individual multi
heads and the FX on the complete heads can be mixed together.



=== Programming LED using standard FX

To program LED fixtures using standard FX rather then the bitmap layers,
just select the fixtures and program them like moving lights.

Select the group of LED fixtures, e.g. "All Pixeline", set the master
intensities using the encoders or by pressing the DIM @ FULL soft button
in the group window.

You can select standard in-built FX for LED fixtures in the Beam window.

To program colour chases across all patched RGB pixels select all the
RGB heads and then in the Colour Window select your base colour, e.g.
Red at 128, Green at 128, Blue at 128. Then play back an FX on the head
such as rgb, cmy or pulse4steps. Speed and size are controlled as
normal.


==== Using groups auto generated from the grid

Press the Auto Group button to automatically generate groups based on
the grid size. This generates groups using the entire grid but with
different orders of selection, e.g. from centre to outside, from the
edges, and vice versa. This makes it easy to quickly generate different
FX.

Using the auto groups, it is then possible to use standard FX such as
RGB, sine waves, pulses to generate FX on your grid.

It is possible to make a group out of the currently selected items within the Grid.  For example, use CTRL + select a few items and then press SHIFT + MAKE GROUP to make a group i nthe Group Window for all those items.


=== Making groups out of LED pixels

To get the best out of a large array of pixel heads it is best to make
groups. Select all the RGB pixels for a particular fixture and record it
as a group. The order in which you select the heads determines the order
that FX are played back on them. You can reverse the selection of an
entire group by pressing the top right soft button in the Group Window.

If you have set up a Grid in the Plan View then you can easily select
the pixel heads from this View before recording the group in the Group
Window. Use Auto Groups to generate groups in different directions on
the group and from the centre outwards.

In the Plan View use SHIFT + MAKE GROUP to make a group from the
currently selected heads. If no text is entered before pressing MAKE
GROUP the group is automatically named based on the first and last head
numbers in the group.

To get a colour rainbow to roll seamlessly across a line of led battens
you may need to reverse the selection of the individual groups - it
depends which way you numbered your LED fixtures.


=== Making new LED personalities on MagicQ

MagicQ has an in-built personality editor, so it is easy to create new
personalities. New personalities can be based on other personalities or
created from a blank personality.

For simple LED fixtures you may be able to use one of the generic LED
personalities - either generic LED 3 chan or generic LED 4 chan.

When creating a personality allocate the red, green and blue channels to
the cyan, magenta and yellow attributes.
