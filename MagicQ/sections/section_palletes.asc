== Palettes
MagicQ supports a comprehensive palette system for easy access to
your favourite looks. When heads are patched, the console
automatically generates palettes for the patched heads.

There are four types of palettes corresponding to Intensity, Colour, Beam and
Position. Each palette supports up to 1000 different entries.


=== Using Palettes

To use a palette, select the heads you wish to apply the change to. Then
open the required palette by selecting one of the Intensity, Colour, Beam or
Position Windows.

From within the window select a palette entry. That palette entry will
be applied to all the selected heads.

In the Beam Window the first 5 soft buttons above the touch screen are
used for selecting the Beam Page 1 to 5 – the rest of the soft buttons
are used for selecting the palette entries.

Palette entries that contain data for the currently selected heads are
shown in white. Palette entries that do not have any data for the
currently selected heads are shown in grey.

In the Colour Window the top soft buttons Col Norm, Col CMY, Col RGB and Col HSI determine how the colour mix encoder wheels are used to modify the colour.

Col Mix is used to select between Palettes and the Lee, Rosco and Generic colour charts and also to select the colour mixing rainbows.

=== Recording Palettes

To record a palette entry, select the heads you wish to apply the change
to. Then open the required palette by selecting one of the Intensity, Colour, Beam
or Position Windows.

Modify the attributes of the heads until you are happy with them. Then
record the palette entry by pressing RECORD and then selecting the
palette entry in the window.

When you record a palette entry that has already been used in
programming of Cues and Cue Stacks then the Cues and Cue Stacks will be
updated to reflect the changes. This is useful, for example, for touring
shows that play many different venues. If the Cues use positions from
the Position palette, then each day it is only necessary to change the
palette entries, rather than having to re-record all the Cues.

When palettes are recorded, only the attributes appropriate to the
palette are recorded. So when recording to the colour palette, only
colour attributes are stored. By default, the console records all the
attributes appropriate to the palette, regardless of whether you have
adjusted them in the programmer.

Palette values are shown in the Output, Programmer and Cue windows by a small black rectangle in the bottom left corner.

==== Recording individual attributes into a Palette

You may wish only to record only certain attributes into a palette entry
– e.g. only the shutter attribute into the beam palette. You can modify
the way the console records palettes using masking in the Record Options
window. Open the Record Options Window when recording by holding SHIFT
and pressing RECORD. Alternatively press the REC OPTIONS soft button in
the Programmer Window.

Press the REC INT, REC POS, REC COL, REC BEAM soft buttons to apply
masking based on attribute type. Select attributes in the window to
apply masking based on individual attributes. For instance to store only
the shutter attribute, press the SHUTTER attribute.

In some circumstances you may wish to record other attributes into a
palette – e.g. intensity into a beam palette. Simply press the
appropriate buttons in the Record Options Window. The Palette entry
shows I, P, C, B to indicate which attributes are stored in the Palette.

Once the Palette entry is recorded the masking options are returned to
their defaults. You can lock the mask so that it is not returned to the
defaults by pressing the LOCK MASK soft button in the Record Options
Window.

==== Recording only the selected heads

By default when recording palette entries, changes are only made for selected
heads. The modifications are merged with the existing palette entries.

To ensure that all heads that have been changed are updated, press CTRL
+ ALL to select all heads in the programmer before re-recording the
palette entry.

It is possible to set the "Recording to Palettes" option to "All Heads in Programmer" to force all heads that are active in the programmer to be updated in the palette rather than just the selected heads.


=== Intensity Palettes

From v1.6.5.1 the Intensity window has been enhanced to have a View Palettes view similar to the Position, Colour and Beam windows.  Palettes can be recorded, moved, copied and removed and used within Cues just as with Position, Colour and Beam palettes.  

By default only Intensity parameters are recorded into the Intensity Palettes regardless of whether other attributes are in the programmer.  A record mask (SHIFT + RECORD) can be used to override which attributes are recorded.

The only difference with Intensity Palettes compared to Position, Colour and Beam palettes is that by default the record type is set to all heads that have intensity in the Programmer being recorded into the Palette not just the selected heads.  This avoids the need to always select heads (e.g. by selecting the All Dimmers group) before recording an Intensity Palette.  The record type can be changed by pressing SHIFT RECORD and selecting RECORD TYPE.

To record intensity into a Colour, Beam or Position Palette hold SHIFT and press RECORD to open the Record Options Window (as above) and select the REC INT soft button.


=== Naming Palettes

A palette can be named when it is recorded by keying in the name before
selecting the palette entry to record.

A palette can be named at any time by keying in the name, pressing SET
and selecting the palette entry. If you are not using an external
keyboard the select the palette entry, press SET and enter the name on
the on screen keyboard.


=== Updating Palettes

A palette can be updated simply be selecting some heads, applying the
palette and then re-recording the palette. Only the heads that are
selected when you re-record the palette will be modified in the palette
- other heads recorded in the palette will not be changed.

A complete palette can be edited using Include and Update. Press Include
and then select the Palette entry to include the entire palette into the
programmer. The console automatically selects all the heads that are in
the Palette entry. Modifications can then be made in the programmer, and
when complete pressing Update stores the changes back to the Palette.


=== Copying and moving Palettes

Palette entries can be moved and copied just like any other window item.

When a palette entry is moved, programming follows the palette entry -
i.e. if you have a Cue which uses a Colour palette entry, then moving
that Colour palette entry, will cause the Cue to be updated to continue
to reference the palette entry.


=== Removing attributes from Palettes

You can delete an entire palette entry by using REMOVE as with any
window item.

To remove specific attributes from a palette entry you can use the REC
REMOVE record option. This works in a similar way to the normal record
mode – except that where items in the programmer are normally merged
into the palette entry, they are now removed.

The MASK IPCB and MASK ATTRIB record options enable selection of which
options are deleted as for normal recording of palette entries.

For example, to remove the shutter attribute from a previously recorded
beam palette entry; clear the programmer, select the heads, and modify
the shutter attribute only. Then press SHIFT and RECORD, and select the
REC REMOVE and MASK ATTRIB, Shutter record options. Then select the
palette entry.


=== Linked Palettes

If you select a Palette and then record it as another Palette without
changing any of the attributes then all the values in the new Palette
will be linked to the first Palette. Changing any of the attributes in
the first Palette will change the attributes in the new Palette. This is
a linked Palette. MagicQ shows a L in the Palette entry to indicate a
linked Palette.

When you change attributes using the encoder wheels or soft buttons then
the Palette will contain hard values instead of links.

It is possible to unlink a Palette from the View Palette Window. Put the
cursor on the Palette Entry you wish to unlink, press VIEW PALETTE and
then UNLINK.

Only one level of linking is allowed – a Palette can link to another
Palette, but it is not possible to link to further Palettes.


=== Viewing / Editing Palette contents

You can view the contents of a palette entry at any time by pressing the
VIEW PALETTE soft button in the Colour, Beam and Position windows. This
opens the Palette View window and shows the contents of the palette
entry that the cursor was on in the Colour, Beam or Position Window.

image:images/paletteview.png[image]

Note that the View Palette window shows the entire contents of the
palette entry regardless of which heads are currently selected. You can
modify the contents of the palette entry by editing the values in the
spread-sheet. You can remove values, entire heads, or entire attributes
from the palette entry using the REMOVE button.

The View Palette, View Used window can be used to determine how many
times Palettes have been used within a show.

The View Palettes window shows whether Palettes are linked to other
Palettes (highlighted in Red). There is a button to unlink the specific
Palettes or using SHIFT, to unlink all the Palettes of that type
(Position, Colour or Beam). Unlinking removes links within the Palettes
to other Palettes – it does not affect the links within Cues.

It is possible to step through the different Palettes using the Next
Palette and Previous Palette buttons.

=== Using Palettes with times

Palettes can be applied with a time by simply typing in a number of
seconds before selecting the Palette - this is very useful for quickly
setting fade times when recording Cues or for busking in effects. In
addition you can use FAN mode to quickly spread different times across a
number of heads.

For example, typing in 3 before selecting a position will cause a fade
to the position over 3 seconds.

Typing 0 THRU 3 before selecting a position causes the heads to move to
the position with a spread of 3 seconds - i.e. the first head moves
immediately whilst the last head takes 3 seconds.

To fan delays, rather than fade times, type delay / fade – e.g. for 1
second fade but delayed from 0 to 3 seconds type 0 THRU 3 / 1 before
selecting the palette.

A short-cut can be used to perform fanned delay/fades – type a time
followed by * before selecting the Palette to fan the fade across the
currently selected heads.

Applying Palettes with times and fanned times can be applied to all
Palette types including Beam and Colour. For example to perform a
gradual fade from one colour to the next over all your colour mixing
heads, select the heads, 0 THRU 5 before selecting a colour palette
entry.

You can modify the order that a fan is applied to heads by selecting the
heads in the appropriate order - at any time you can invert the order
using the Selection soft button in the Group Window.

Whenever a Palette is selected with a time the times are stored in the
programmer. This makes it very easy to build up Cues with times. Simply
select the Palettes you want with the required times and Record the Cue.
The Cue will playback with the required times.

==== Using FAN

You can set both delay and fade times in FAN mode by entering delay /
fade. For example to move all your heads onto a position in turn, type 2
/ 2 before selecting the position.

Minimum fade times can be applied using the + operator, for example to
perform a fade of between 2 and 6 seconds to a new position on a group
of heads enter FAN mode, type 2+4 and select the new position. The first
head will fade over 2 seconds whilst the last will fade over 6 seconds.

To use both minimum delay and fade times type, for example, 2+4/3+5.
This gives delay times of between 2 and 6, and fade times of between 3
and 8 seconds.

=== Making Palettes into Cue Stacks

You can copy one or more palettes from the Position, Colour or Beam
windows to a Playback (use SHIFT + cursor keys to select multiple
items). This enables quick generation of Cue Stacks based on your
palettes.

The Cue Stack will include one Cue for every Palette selected. The Cues
will contain values from the Palette for the currently selected heads.
Other attributes can be added using Record Merge.

If a Cue Stack already exists on the Playback, then the extra Cues are
appended to the end of the Cue Stack.

Copying a Group to a Playback makes a Cue with Intensity at 100% for all
the channels in the Group. Selecting multiple groups using the cursor
(SHIFT + cursor keys) and then copying to a Playback creates a multi
step Cue Stack of intensities – one Cue step for each group. This is an
easy way to create, for example an intensity chase of your different
moving light groups or your different par can colour groups.


=== Selecting Palettes from the keypad

You can select palettes from the keypad. Enable the Setup Option, “Select
channels in Beam, Col, Pos”.   To select a palette use:

COL 5 ENTER

BEAM 3 ENTER

Timed fades can be entered at the same time – e.g. to apply colour
palette 5 with a time of 4 seconds spread across all the selected heads:

COL 5 / 4 * ENTER

It is possible to record, include and remove Palettes from the keypad:

RECORD GROUP <group number> ENTER

RECORD POS <palette entry> ENTER

RECORD COL<palette entry> ENTER

RECORD BEAM <palette entry> ENTER

=== Merging of Palettes from another show

It is possible to merge Palettes from any previous show that uses the same type of heads - you can select
the palettes from a specific head or all the heads that match with your
current show.

It is possible to select Position, Beam or Colour palettes, or
combinations of the three attribute types.

To import the Palettes, press the LOAD PALETTES soft button in the View
Palette window.

Alternatively from the Setup Window press the SHIFT + IMPORT SHOW soft
button and select Palettes.


=== Modifying Palettes in the personality

When palettes are recorded they become part of the show data and can be
used during programming of the show. In the normal mode of operation
recording palettes does not affect the personality file. This ensures
that changes you make for the purposes of the show do not affect future
shows.

However, it is sometimes necessary to update the personality file -
either because the data in the personality file is incorrect, or to add
extra palettes entries to the personality. Pressing SHIFT when you
select the palette entry to record, causes the changes to be copied
through into the personality.

When recording through into the personality file, the console takes the
first selected head and copies the data associated with the palette
entry you selected into the personality file. If the palette entry is
already in the personality file (i.e. there is a palette entry with the
same name as the one you selected) then that palette entry is replaced.
Otherwise a new palette entry is created in the file.

You can examine the personality file, by going into the Patch Window and
pressing the Edit Head soft button. Then press the Select Head button to
choose the personality to examine.


=== Grabbing Palettes from DMX input

You can program palettes by capturing real DMX data from another
consoles. This provides a handy way of converting show data from one
console type to another, or to back up data from one console on another.

To capture real DMX data, first select the heads you are interested in.
Then change to the appropriate Palette Window - Intensity, Position,
Colour or Beam. Press CTRL and RECORD then select a Palette entry – this
will load the DMX input data for the selected heads into the programmer
and record it into the specified Palette entry.

Alternatively use Include to get the data into the programmer and record
the Palette entry in the normal way for recording palette entries. Press
CTRL and INCLUDE and then ENTER. This will include the DMX input data
for the selected heads into the programmer. The data can then be stored
into a Palette in the usual way using RECORD.

You can grab all attributes of a moving head by changing to the Group
window, pressing CTRL and INCLUDE, then ENTER.
