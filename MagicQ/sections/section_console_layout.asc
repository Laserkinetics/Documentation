== MagicQ Layout
=== Physical layout

All MagicQ consoles are very similar - they differ mainly in the number of
playback faders. The programming interface is consistent across the
entire range of consoles.  MagicQ software on PC and Mac mimics the layout of the physical buttons on the MagicQ Consoles - a choice of different Panels is available from the Panel Menu.  The Full Panel mode mimics Pro and Compact whilst the Stadium Panem mode mimics the MQ1000.  It is possible to change between different panel views at any time - it does not affect the programmed show - it just determines what buttons, faders and encoders are available for programming and playback.

==== Touch Screen, Encoders & Soft Buttons

There are 24 buttons and 8 rotary encoders placed around the touch
screen.

The buttons are referred to as soft buttons since their function changes
according to the active window on the touch screen. The current function
of a soft button is displayed on the touch screen adjacent to the
button. To select the function you can either press the screen or the
soft button itself.

The function of the rotary encoders also changes according to the active
window with the current function being displayed adjacent to the
encoder.

At the top left and top right of the touch screen there are SHIFT and
CTRL buttons. Pressing theses buttons selects alternate functions for
the soft buttons and encoders.

==== Windows

The area in the centre of the screen is the windows section in which the
various control windows are displayed. There are two main types of
windows – boxes style windows which have large boxes such as the Group
Window and spreadsheet style editing windows such as the Patch Window.

A window is displayed by pressing the appropriate window button.  On MagicQ PC/Mac the window can be selected from the Window Menu from the toolbar.
Changing window does not affect programming or playback.

Multiple windows can be displayed at one time by sizing and positioning the windows
appropriately using the SIZE button.  On MagicQ PC/Mac the size and position can be selected from the View Menu from the toolbar.

In addition a complete configuration of windows – i.e. a complete layout can be selected using the Layout buttons - to select the Palettes layout (Groups, Positions, Colours and
Beams) press the Layout 1 button.  Layouts 1 to 12 can also be selected using CTRL and the top soft buttons.

When a window button is pressed, that window becomes the active window.
The active window is on the top of the screen and is easily identified
as the window with the highlighted title bar at the top. It is also the
window with the cursor in it.

An item in a window can be selected either

1.  By pressing the touch screen over the appropriate part of the window
2.  By moving the cursor to the appropriate position and pressing the
ENTER button.
3.  By moving the mouse to the position and pressing the left mouse
button.

The cursor can be moved around the active window using the cursor keys
in the Editor area of the console or via the cursor keys on the
keyboard. PG UP, PG DN, PG LEFT and PG RIGHT can be used to scroll the
window in the appropriate direction. HOME and END can be used to get to
the start and end of the window respectively.

Towards the bottom of the touch screen are two small windows, the Status
Display and the Input Display. The Status Display shows the current date
and time, the ADD / SWAP status of the console and other relevant status
information.

The Input Display shows the data that has been currently entered through
the keypad and the keyboard. Note that text is not entered into the main
Windows until ENTER is pressed. This allows the user to choose whether
the keyboard data is SET into fields in the windows or onto Playbacks.

After a command has been entered it also confirms that the command has
been accepted and shows any error messages when a command is not
possible.


==== Head Control

The area around the two large rotary encoders is referred to as the head
control area. It is used to alter the parameters of individual heads and
apply effects such as fans over groups of heads.

The NEXT HEAD and PREV HEAD buttons are used to select an individual
head to modify.

The other buttons control the selection mode; LOCATE, HIGHLIGHT, FAN,
SINGLE, ODD/EVEN, and ALL.



==== Editor Buttons

The Editor buttons are used to modify program data. The 8 buttons on the
right hand side are the action buttons which are used to modify show
data. The action buttons are UNDO, REMOVE, MOVE, COPY, SET, INCLUDE, UPDATE, and RECORD.

The buttons on the left:

BLIND and CLEAR affect the programmer

REL and SELECT affect playbacks

SHIFT selects alternate functions

<-- undoes keyboard input and clears actions



==== Playback

The Playback area is situated directly below the touch screen and
consists of 10 playbacks each with a fader and four buttons (FLASH, GO,
STOP, SELECT). The area above each of the playbacks on the touch screen
is used to provide information about the status of the playback.

The playback area also contains a Grand Master, a Sub Master, Page
Select buttons and a Manual Playback for taking control of Cue Stacks.

The cross fade section contains a GO, STOP. FWD, BCK buttons, a cross
fader and a master GO button. The cross fade section controls the
current playback selected with the S button.



=== Keyboard, Keypad, Select & Confirm Windows

MagicQ has a set of additional on-screen Windows that can be used to
enter text, select items and confirm actions. You can choose whether you
use the physical keyboard/keypad to navigate around these items or
whether you use the mouse/touch.

To open the Keyboard Window at any time press SET SET. To open the icon
selector press SHIFT + SET.

Confirm Windows are shown when you carry out important actions that may
overwrite or delete show data. You can confirm an action by pressing 1
on the keypad. To cancel the action press 0 on the keypad.



=== Common Actions

MagicQ utilises many common actions for carrying out programming
functions. All the actions use similar button presses. Once you
understand the action in one Window, you will understand how it is done
in another Window.

We strongly recommend you make yourself familiar with these actions –
they will save you valuable programming time.


==== Items

Actions in a Window can be carried out on individual items or on multiple
items. For actions on a single item, use the cursor keys to move around
the Window so that the cursor is over the required item.

For multiple items in a Window, move the cursor to the first item. Then
press and hold the SHIFT button whilst moving the cursor to the last
item. All the items will be highlighted.

Alternatively hold the CTRL button and select multiple individual items.

In spreadsheet style Windows (e.g. Patch) pressing the touch screen or
left clicking on the item with the mouse moves the cursor to the item.
You can highlight multiple Window items by pressing the touch screen and
moving the touch across multiple items.

In boxes style Windows (e.g. Group), pressing the touch screen or left
clicking performs the function associated with the item (e.g. recalls
that Group). In these Windows use SHIFT or CTRL and the cursor keys to
highlight multiple boxes.


==== Setting the value of items

To set the value of one or more items in a spreadsheet style window:

* Move the cursor over the item (s)
* Enter a value on the keypad and press ENTER.

OR

* Type in the value on the keypad
* Press the touch screen / click / ENTER over the item.

For items that have a simple value of yes or no if you do not enter a
value on the keypad then the value will toggle. For items that have
multiple values double click on the field for a list of values. On the
touch screen select the field and then press anywhere in the Input
Display (right side area underneath the main window) to bring up the
list of values.

Items that are coloured darker are read only and therefore cannot be
set.


==== Naming items

* Press the SET button
* Press the touch screen / click / ENTER over the item to name.
* Enter the name on the external or on screen keyboards

When working in spreadsheets style windows with an external keyboard it
is not necessary to press the SET button in the above sequence - you can
edit the spreadsheet like any other, just by moving to the appropriate
box and entering text on the keyboard.

To name multiple items highlight it is often easier to highlight the
items before pressing SET. If you press SET immediately after
highlighting multiple items then the console will assume that these are
the items you wish to set.

You can also press SET instead of pressing ENTER in the above sequences.


==== Moving items

* Press the MOVE button.
* Press the touch screen / click / ENTER over the source item.
* Press the touch screen / click / ENTER over the destination item.

You can also press MOVE instead of pressing ENTER in the above
sequences.

To move multiple items it is often easier to highlight the items before
pressing MOVE. If you press MOVE immediately after highlighting multiple
items then the console will assume that these are the source items and
will only prompt for the destination. You can hold SHIFT or CTRL to
highlight multiple items.

==== Copying items

* Press the COPY button.
* Press the touch screen / click / ENTER over the source item.
* Press the touch screen / click / ENTER over the destination item.

You can also press COPY instead of pressing ENTER in the above sequence.

To copy multiple items highlight it is often easier to highlight the
items before pressing COPY. If you press COPY immediately after
highlighting multiple items then the console will assume that these are
the source items and will only prompt for the destination. You can hold
SHIFT or CTRL to highlight multiple items.

When copying Cues, Cue Stacks or Pages the console by default does not
make individual copies of the Cues - the Cue Stacks link to the same
Cues. To copy unlinked (i.e. to create new Cues) then press SHIFT and
COPY in the above sequence.


==== Removing items

* Press the REMOVE button.
* Press the touch screen / click / ENTER over the item to remove.

To remove multiple items highlight it is often easier to highlight the
items before pressing REMOVE. If you press REMOVE immediately after
highlighting multiple items then the console will assume that you wish
to remove the highlighted items.

You can also press REMOVE instead of pressing ENTER in the above
sequence.


==== Recording items

In boxes style windows it is possible to record an item (e.g. in the
Group Window, to record a group):

* Press the RECORD button.
* Press the touch screen / click / ENTER over the item to record.

You can also press RECORD instead of pressing ENTER in the above
sequence.

=== Icons

MagicQ supports icons for all programmed items. The size of the icons can be set
in the Window Settings in the Setup Window.
 
Icons can be used on Groups, Colours, Beams, Positions, Cues, Cue Stacks
and in the Execute Window.

To set an icon for a Window item (e.g. a Palette Entry) press SHIFT SET. Press the touch screen / click / ENTER over the item to set an icon for.  This will open the Icon library. The Icon library is split into
different types of Icons for colours, positions and different types of gobos.

Select the icon from the icon library.


==== Actions on Playbacks

Actions on playbacks are similar to window items except that the S buttons are used instead of window items.

To select a Playback, press the S button for the appropriate
Playback.

To record a Playback, press RECORD, then press the S button for the
appropriate Playback.

To name a Playback press SET, then press the S button for the
Playback. Enter the name using the on screen keyboard or the external
keyboard.

To move a Playback, press MOVE, then press the S button for the
source Playback and then press the S button for the destination
Playback.

To copy a Playback, press COPY, then press the S button for the
source Playback and then press the S button for the destination
Playback.

To include the contents of a Playback into the Programmer, press
INCLUDE, then press the S button for the destination Playback.

To remove a Playback, press REMOVE, then press the S button for the
Playback. Press the S button again to confirm the remove.
