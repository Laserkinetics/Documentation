== Editing Cues

=== Including Cues into the Programmer

A programmed Cue can be included back into the Programmer so that the
information can be used to program further Cues. When a Cue is included
all the level, timing and FX information is loaded. The only exception
is if the Programmer already contains FX information for the heads - in
this case the FX information from the Cue is ignored.

Cues can be included directly from Playbacks - the current Cue in the
Cue Stack is included. Cues can also be included from the Cue Stack, Cue
and Cue Store Windows.

Including of Cues is an easy way to edit Cues. You can also use the
Record Options to specify that only part of the Cue should be included
into the programmer – for example only selected heads or only certain
attributes. Press SHIFT and INCLUDE to get the options.

Masking can be selected quickly by holding Intensity, Position, Beam or
Colour and pressing INCLUDE for including only the selected attributes.

By default only the data recorded into the specified Cue is included
into the programmer. Use the Entire State option when including Cues
into the programmer to include the whole tracking state of a Cue. The
short cue ALL + INCLUDE can be used to select Entire State.

When Cues are included into the Programmer then the channels from the
Cue are automatically selected if the Setup option “Select Heads on
Include” is set. At any time, CTRL + ALL selects all heads in the
programmer.


==== Including Cues at a specified level

By default Include loads the Cue into the programmer at 100%. It is
possible to modify this action using the keypad to use selected levels.

To include a Playback or Cue at a particular level (e.g. 40%), press
INCLUDE, type @ 40 and select the Playback or Cue to include.

To include a playback at its current level press INCLUDE, type @ and
press the Select button of the playback.


==== Snapshot

The Snapshot function enables the complete current output to be loaded
into the programmer and hence recorded into a Cue. This function takes
the Cues running on all active playbacks and includes them into the
programmer based on the level of the fader. Both channel information and
FX information is included into the programmer.

To snapshot the current output, open the Programmer Window and press the
Snapshot soft button.

There is a shortcut for recording a complete snapshot - hold THRU and
press REC.



=== Editing using Include and Update method

Cues can be edited using INCLUDE and UPDATE. This includes the Cue data
into the programmer where it can then be changed, before it is saved
back to the Cue using Update.

First, clear the Programmer, then include the required Cue back into the
Programmer. Modify the required values in the Programmer and then use
Update to re-record the Cue.

You can include multiple Cues into the programmer. When you press
UPDATE, the last Cue that you included will be modified. The Status
Display shows which Cue was the last one to be Included.


=== Record Merge (Updating a Cue with the contents of the programmer)

You can quickly and easily merge the contents of the programmer into the
current Cue on a Playback by holding the S button for the playback and
pressing REC. The programmer is merged into the current Cue on the
Playback.

To merge into a specific Cue on a Playback, hold + and REC to select
Record Merge and then type the Cue ID on the keypad before pressing the
S button for the Playback.


=== Making changes to multiple Cues

Changes can be made to multiple Cues using the REC MERGE and REC REMOVE
record options to specify a change in the programmer which is then
merged with or removed from a number of Cues.

There are some short-cuts for selecting RECORD MERGE and RECORD REMOVE

Hold ‘+’ and press REC for REC MERGE

Hold ‘-‘ and press REC for REC REMOVE


==== Changes to multiple Cues using keypad

MagicQ supports record merging / record removing to a range of cues
using the keypad – for example, to merge into Cue ids 2 through 4:

RECORD MERGE 2 THRU 4 S

This function also works for the shortcuts – e.g. holding S and then
typing a range of Cue Ids before pressing RECORD.

Both the THRU and the + and – operators are supported.


==== Changes to multiple Cues using Cue Stack window

To remove all the pan and tilt information for a group of heads from all
the Cues in a Cue Stack on a particular playback.

Clear the programmer.

Select the heads and modify the pan and tilt attributes.

Open the Cue Stack Window and select the playback with the Cue Stack to
modify.

In the Cue Window, use cursor keys to select all the Cues (PG LEFT,
HOME, SHIFT+END).

Press SHIFT + RECORD and select REC REMOVE record option.

Press ENTER.



=== Editing using Update

MagicQ supports a function for easy updating of Cues and Palettes
without first Including the Cues and Palettes. This is useful when
making modifications to a pre-programmed show.

When you press Update (when not in Include Mode) a list of all the
Palettes and Cues that have been over-riden is shown. You can then
choose which of the Palettes and Cues to update by selecting from the
select box. One you have finished your selection press the “Done”
button. You can press “Cancel” at any point to cancel the Update.

When using a tracking Cue Stack, MagicQ will show all the Cues that have
been overriden in the Stack – hence you can make an update even if the
attributes were used in a previous Cue on that Cue Stack.

Pressing SHIFT + UPDATE forces an update using the above method even if
a Cue was previously included.


=== Direct Modification of Intensities in Cues

To add or change the intensity of heads (or dimmer channels) recorded into a Cue on a Playback without using the programmer, press and hold the SELECT button of the Playback with the Cue to be modified.  Then use the keypad to adjust the intensity channels – e.g. typing 1 THRU 4 @ FULL will add channels 1 to 4 at FULL into the current Cue on the Playback.  The change is immediate and permanent.  The programmer is not affected.

Setting intensities in a Cue can be absolute - e.g. setting some heads to 50%  - or relative, e.g. setting some heads +10%  where they are already used.

To remove a level from the current Cue on a Cue Stack – hold the S button and set the channel at the special level pass:[. .] 

 For example, whilst holding S type

1 @ FULL		Sets head 1 to FULL in current cue on Playback with S held
1 @ +10		        Adjusts head 1 intensity +10% in current cue on Playback with S held
1 @ FULL THRU	        Sets head 1 to FULL in all cues on Playback with S held
1 @ +10 THRU		Adjusts head 1 intensity +10% in all cues on Playback with S held
1 @ .. THRU		Removes head 1 intensity in all cues on Playback with S held


Note that in order to use THRU at the end of the syntax line to select all Cues in the Playback the Setup option, View Setup, View Settings, Keypad,  Auto Enter on Intensity Set, must be set to No.
