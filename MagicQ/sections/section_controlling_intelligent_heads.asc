== Controlling Attributes

MagicQ supports many different ways of modifying the values of
attributes for moving heads - using encoders, using buttons, and using
the touch screen.

In order to control intelligent heads it is necessary to be able to
select which heads to use. MagicQ keeps track of the
currently selected heads to enable it to determine which heads to apply
changes to. You can select heads individually or can use groups
to recall configurations of heads that are used frequently.

=== Selecting Heads

MagicQ automatically generates a group for all the heads of a
particular head type. In addition new groups can easily be recorded.

The Group Window has two views. VIEW GROUPS enables selection of heads
using groups whilst VIEW HEADS enables individual selection of heads.

In VIEW GROUPS, pressing the touch screen for a particular group selects
all the heads associated with that group. All other heads are
deselected.

In VIEW HEADS, individual heads are selected by pressing the touch
screen. All other heads are deselected. Use PG UP and PG DN to scroll
through the heads. To select multiple heads hold SHIFT and press a head.
The head will be toggled in and out of selection.

=== Using Groups

Once a group has been recorded, then pressing the touch screen for the
group will make all the heads in the group selected. All other heads
will be deselected. To select multiple groups press SHIFT and a group to
toggle the group in and out of selection. (Note that you can change an
option in the Setup Window to enable multiple groups to be selected
without pressing SHIFT.)

When in the VIEW GROUPS view you can also use the keypad to select a
group - simply enter the group number. You can use + and - to select
multiple groups.

Pressing + before a group is selected adds the group to previously
selected heads, i.e. the heads in the group are all selected as before,
but other heads are not deselected.

For example to select groups 1 and 3 press

1 + 3 ENTER

To deselect group 4 from the selection press

pass:[- 4 ENTER]

MagicQ generates groups for each head as they are patched. In
addition MagicQ can generate <<autogroups,auto groups>> based on
gel colour and head name.


==== Recording a Group

Select the heads you want in a group in the VIEW HEADS view of the Group
Window.

Change to the VIEW GROUPS view.

Press RECORD and then select the group you wish to record either by
pressing the touch screen or by using the cursor keys and then pressing
ENTER.


==== Naming a Group

When recording a group, if you key in a name before pressing the touch
screen (or pressing ENTER) then the group will be named at the same time
as it is recorded.

You can name a group at any time by keying in the name, pressing SET,
and pressing the touch screen.

If you do not have a keyboard then press SET and select the group to
name by pressing the touch screen (or using cursor keys and ENTER). A
keyboard window will be displayed for you to enter the name on screen.


=== Selecting Heads using the keypad

Heads can be selected based on the head numbers of your dimmers / moving
lights - if you intend to use this method then you should set up the
head numbers of your lamps when patching. It is easy to do; MagicQ
can automatically renumber them, or they can be set to be the same as
the DMX start address of the dimmer / head. See the section on
<<patching,patching>>.

By default on MagicQ the keypad is used for many functions including
selecting heads, settings times, editing fields in spread sheets. This
is different to some other consoles which primarily use the keypad for
selection of heads. On MagicQ it is possible to select heads directly
form the keypad at any time by entering the head numbers terminated by
@@.


==== Selecting Heads on the keypad using @@

To select heads 1 to 4 key in

1 THRU 4 @@

To select heads 1 to 4 and heads 8 to 11 key in

1 THRU 4 + 8 THRU 11 @@

To select heads 1 through 12 but not head 7 key in

1 THRU 12 - 7 @@

To select all heads of a certain type without specifying the entire
range use

1 THRU @@

This selects all heads of the same type as head 1 starting at head no 1
in ascending head order until it reaches a head that is not of the same
type.

At any time you can select all of the heads of a particular type
(regardless of head no) by selecting one of the heads and then using
SHIFT ALL

1 @@

SHIFT ALL

Note that on MagicQ PC you can use > to indicate THRU.

@@ 0 deselects all heads.

To sub select an element of a multi element head use the dot operator,
for example head 1 element 2.

pass:[1 . 2 @@]
pass:[. 3 @@]		// Select 3rd element of currently selected heads
pass:[. 1 > 3 @@]	// Select 1st, 2nd and 3rd elements of currently selected heads
pass:[. 1 + 4 @@]	// Select 1st and 4th elements of currently selected heads

==== Selecting heads on the keypad without @@

It is also possible to set the Setup Option “Keypad always select head”.
In this mode entering numbers on the keypad always selects heads –
however, to perform other operations, like editing fields in the spread
sheet views, you need to press the SET button first.

An alternative to using @@ is to use @ ENTER. This is only supported if
the <<selectheadsonkeypadintensity,Select heads on intensity set>>
option is set. This method works by detecting @ in the keyboard input
and instead of passing the input to the active Window it attempts to
parse the input as setting intensities for / selecting heads.

When selecting Colour, Beam or Positions the @@ can be replaced by COL,
BEAM or POS if you set the Select Heads and Palettes from keypad] Setup option. For example:

1 > 4 COL 5 ENTER

Selects heads 1 to 4 and applies Colour Palette 5.


==== Remove Dimmer (Rem Dim) Function

The keypad now supports functionality to enable selecting of individual
selections of heads and automatically setting all other heads to zero
intensity – this is similar to the “Rem Dim” function found in some
other theatre consoles. After selecting heads or setting intensities for
heads, type - -.

For example, 1 THRU 4 @ FULL - - will set heads 1 to 4 at full intensity
and all other heads in the programmer will have their intensity set to
zero.

4 THRU 8 – will bring heads 4 to 8 at full intensity into the
programmer, whilst all other heads in the programmer will be set to zero
intensity.


=== Selecting heads using the rig plan view

Heads can be selected from a plan of the rig in the View Plan view of
the Outputs window. See <<_plan_view,Plan View>>.


=== Head Macros

MagicQ loads macros for the head from the personality file. Typical
macros are "Lamp On", "Lamp Off" and "Reset" - however they are very
head dependent.

The "Lamp On", “Lamp Off” and “Reset” macros can be run at any time by
using the following short-cuts:

SHIFT + LOCATE Lamp on selected heads

CTRL + LOCATE Reset selected heads

CTRL + SHIFT + LOCATE Lamp off selected heads

Other head macros can be accessed in the Macro Window - press the HEAD
MACRO soft button. A list of the available macros is displayed. Select
the macro you wish to run. Progress of the macro is shown in the Input
Display.

It is also possible to lamp on or off all fixtures from the MACRO
window.

=== Locating Heads

The first action you are likely to want to do is to locate the heads –
i.e. to put them into a starting position. Select the required heads and
then press the LOCATE button.

Pressing LOCATE, locates all the selected heads. LOCATE places all the
attributes of the head into the Programmer at their default values. The
personality data for each head specifies what happens to a head when it
is located. Typically the shutter is opened, the dimmer is set to 100%
and pan and tilt are set to the centre position.

You can locate individual attribute types by holding one of the Pos,
Col, Beam or Intensity buttons and pressing LOCATE. Only attributes of
that type are located and placed in the Programmer.


=== Modifying Attributes

Intelligent heads have several different attributes typically including
pan and tilt, colour, gobo and iris. When MagicQ patches an intelligent head it maps the head parameters to standard
attributes to enable easy access of the features of the head.

Attributes are categorised into four types – Intensity, Position, Colour and Beam.
On MagicQ there is a window for each of these attribute types.  Select the required heads, then open the required window.

The window enables the control of all the attributes of that attribute
type using the eight rotary encoders. In the Beam Window there are more
than eight attributes to be controlled – these are accessed using
multiple pages of encoders – by pressing the PAGE 1, PAGE 2, PAGE 3, PAGE 4 or
PAGE 5 soft buttons or pressing the BEAM button again.

For indexed attributes such as colour wheels and gobo wheels, the button
associated with each encoder can be used to bump the attribute value to
the next range. Pressing SHIFT and the button bumps back to the previous
range.

In addition the window enables selection of palette values for the
attribute type using the touch screen. When heads are recorded the
system automatically generates palettes for each attribute type. You can
record new palette entries, or modify existing ones as you see fit.

In the Colour Window there is a COL MIX soft button which gives access
to libraries of pre-programmed colours. Pressing the COL MIX soft button
toggles between the normal palette view and the colour mixing view. In
the colour mixing view you can select a colour using the touch screen.
The COL TYPE soft button enables the user to choose between the default
colour library, the Lee colour library or the Rosco colour library.

To modify a 16bit parameter in high (i.e. 16 bit resolution), hold SHIFT
and turn the appropriate encoder.

Layout 1 opens the Group, Position, Colour and Beam windows together.

=== Using a mouse or track-ball to control pan and tilt

It is possible to use the mouse or trackball for pan/tilt control.
Enable the “Enable Mouse to control pan/tilt” option in Setup Window,
View Settings.

Press the Right mouse button to enter pan/tilt mode. In this mode the
mouse or trackball can be used to control pan and tilt of any selected
heads. Press again to return to normal mode.

Support for this function is only available on MagicQ consoles and on MagicQ PC/Mac when
connected to a MagicQ PC Wing or MagicQ MaxiWing. It is not available
when connected to MagicQ MiniWing or MagicQ USB interface as these
products do not have X and Y encoders.

MagicQ consoles support mice and track balls.


=== Flip / Mirror

Flip modifies the pan and tilt parameters of a moving head so that the
beam is positioned in the same place but from the other end of its
movement ranges. Select the fixtures and then press the FLIP soft button
in the Position Window.

Use the MIRROR soft button in the Position Window to only invert the Pan attribute and not the tilt
attribute.  On older software versions press SHIFT + FLIP.

The MQ1000 includes a dedicated MIRROR button.  On Compact consoles (MQ40, MQ60, MQ70) press ALT + FAN.

=== Setting attribute values using the keypad

You can set attribute values directly by pressing SET, entering the
value on the keypad and then pressing the soft button for attribute in
the Intensity, Position, Colour and Beam windows.


=== Selecting individual Heads

When programming it is often useful to be able to control one head out
of a group of heads - for instance, in order to set up it's position on
the stage. Alternatively you may wish to apply an effect to all the heads, such as fanning the position.

The head control buttons situated to the right of the touch screen
enable the individual head to be selected quickly. Once a number of
heads have been selected for programming, the head control buttons
controls how changes are applied to those heads. By default changes are
applied to all the selected heads.

On MagicQ you first select the overall selection of heads you want to
control using Groups or keypad selection, then you use the head control
buttons to sub-select within that overall selection.

The title bar of the Group, Position, Colour and Beam Windows show the
currently selected heads.

image:images/groupboxs.png[image]

==== Single Mode

Pressing NEXT HEAD, PREV HEAD or SINGLE enters Single mode whereby only
one head from the selected heads is sub selected for operation on at a time. 

When Single mode is first entered control is given to the first head within the selection – i.e.
the first head within the group or the first head the user selected after no heads were selected. 

Single mode is indicated by a LED lit on the SINGLE button.

In Single mode changes made by the encoders or through selecting
Palettes only affect the one sub selected head. The head is
indicated by a * by the head number.

Once in Single mode, the NEXT HEAD and PREV HEAD buttons are used to
transfer control between the selected heads. Pressing the ALL button
returns the head control area to the default mode whereby all selected
heads are controlled.

In Single mode, Locate only affects the sub selected head.


==== Odd/Even

Odd/Even mode is similar to Single mode except that instead of only a
single head, half of the heads are sub selected. Odd/Even
mode is indicated by a LED lit on the ODD/EVEN button.

Pressing ODD/EVEN selects the odd heads. Pressing NEXT HEAD or PREV HEAD
toggles between the odd and even heads. Pressing the ALL button returns
the to the default mode whereby all selected heads are
controlled.

Holding the ODD/EVEN button brings up the Odd/Even toolbar for quick
selection of odd/even or 3s, 4s, 5s. On MagicQ PC/Mac pressing SHIFT and ODD/EVEN opens the toolbar and keeps it open.

image:images/oddeventoolbar.png[image]

Press SHIFT + ODD/EVEN to increase the mode to 3s or more.

==== Pair

Pair mode is similar to Single mode except that instead of only a
single head being sub selected, a symmetrical pair within the selected heads is sub selected.  

Pair mode is indicated by a LED flashing on the SINGLE button.

Pressing NEXT HEAD or PREV HEAD selects the next pair for sub selection.  Pressing the ALL button returns the head control area to the default mode whereby all selected heads are controlled.

The MQ1000 includes a dedicated PAIR button. On Compact consoles (MQ40/60/70) press ALT + SINGLE to get Pair.

==== All

The ALL button is used to return the head control area to the default
mode whereby all heads in the current selection are controlled.

Pressing ALL when there are no heads selected causes the selected heads
that were active when CLEAR was last pressed, to be reselected.

Pressing SHIFT and ALL selects all the heads of the type last selected.

Pressing CTRL + ALL, or FAN + ALL selects all the heads active in the
programmer.

Pressing Next Head and Prev Head reselects all heads in the current
selection (like pressing ALL).


==== Changing Overall Selection order

The order of the overall selection can be changed using the A Soft
Button in the Group Window – the options are “Normal”, “Reverse”, “Into
Centre” and “Centre Out”.

It is also possible to randomise the overall selection order by holding
SHIFT and pressing “RANDOM SELECT”. The overall selection order can be
randomised multiple times to get different random orders. Note that once
the order is randomised it can not be returned to the normal order – to
do this you must reselect the overall selection.

Hold the ALL button to bring up a toolbar showing the above options.


==== Sub selection of heads from Groups / Overall Selection

When you select heads using Groups or the keypad, MagicQ then enables
the operation on a sub selection of the main selection using the Next
Head, Prev Head, Odd/Even, and All buttons. This enables the user to
select a group of heads and work on heads individually without
reselecting the heads.

It is possible to sub select heads from within the main selection using
the keypad and referring to heads using the index of that head within
the overall selection order – for instance, selecting the 1^st^ and
3^rd^ head within the selection, or selecting heads 1 THRU 4 in that
selection. The numbers used are the index into the selection order, not
the head numbers.

To use this method, select a group of heads, then type the index number
followed by NEXT HEAD or PREV HEAD. So to select the 1^st^ and 2^nd^
heads in the current selection:

1+2 NEXT HEAD

Or to the 3^rd^, 4^th^ and 5^th^

3 THRU 5 NEXT HEAD

You can select multiple groups as your main selection – so if you have a
line of 4 spots and 4 washes you can make a group with of all 8 heads
and then access them using the numbers 1 to 8 regardless of their head
number.

Using NEXT HEAD and PREV HEAD without entering a number, operates as
normal, selecting the next or previous head within the overall
selection.


=== Highlight Mode

Highlight mode is used in conjunction with Single mode and Odd/Even
mode. There are four possible modes of operation depending on the
setting in the Setup Window of the Highlight Mode - "Normal”, “Advanced
(highlights/lowlight)”, “Advanced Highlight only” and “Advanced, no
reset”.

In “Normal” mode, the intensities of the selected heads are reduced
except for the one (or ones in Odd/Even mode) that are being controlled.
Highlighting of the controlled head(s) makes programming of positions
much easier.

In "Advanced (highlight/lowlight)” mode, all the attributes of the heads
that are being controlled are set to the highlight values from the
personality. If Single mode or Odd/Even mode is in operation then only
the subset of the selected heads is highlighted – the rest are
lowlighted.

“Advanced Highlight Only” is the same as above, but no lowlighting
occurs.

“Advanced no reset” is the same as “Advanced (highlight/lowlight)” but
is not cleared when you press CLEAR. Press Highlight again to reset it.

When in Highlight mode the LED on the HIGHLIGHT button is lit - pressing
the HIGHLIGHT button again or the ALL button returns the head control
area back to the default mode.


=== Lowlight function

A lowlight function is accessed by pressing SHIFT and HIGHLIGHT. When
active the selected head is lowlighted to the value in the personality.
This allows each head in the current selection to be temporarily
lowlighted to try to find a particular head – without making a massive
change to the current lighting state.

Highlight mode must be set to Advanced highlight/lowlight.


=== Reselecting heads using Palettes and Intensities (Active Palette and Intensity)

To reselect all heads using a particular palette, hold ALL and press the
palette entry.

<Hold ALL> <Green>

Or use the keypad

<Hold ALL> <COL 5 ENTER>

To reselect all heads at or above an intensity level hold ALL and type
the level. Then release ALL or press ENTER.

<Hold ALL> <50 ENTER>

To reselect all heads at a specific intensity level hold ALL and type @
followed by the level. Then release ALL or press ENTER.

<Hold ALL> <@ 60 ENTER>

To reselect all heads active in the programmer

<CTRL> + <ALL>


=== Fan Mode

The FAN button enables a different mode of operation of the encoders
whereby instead of encoder changes being applied to each selected head
in a linear fashion, changes are applied in a fan. Positive changes fan
the heads apart whilst negative changes fan the heads together. Fan mode
cannot be used when Single mode is are active since fanning only makes
sense when more than one head is under control.

Pressing and holding the FAN button enters FAN mode temporarily.
Releasing the FAN button returns to the normal mode.

When you press and hold FAN you get a toolbar on the screen that gives
you direct access to fanning options. On MagicQ PC you can press SHIFTFAN to bring up the FAN toolbar.

image:images/fantoolbar.png[image]


There are 3 types of FAN

Asymmetric (default, as in previous s/w) – fans from centre asymmetric

Symmetric – fans from the centre symmetric

End – fans from the end

It is possible to use “Parts” for fanning parts so that the fan is
replicated across the selected heads. For 2’s, 3’s select the 2 Parts or
3 parts. For higher number of parts, use the N parts option and entering
a number on the keypad. In FAN mode the current FAN type and parts is
shown in the status display window (Fan-A, Fan-S, Fan-E).

It is possible to use “Segments” for fanning segments – adjacent heads
do the same fanning.

It is possible to use “Groups” for fanning. When fanning by groups, the
fan is performed on each group in turn as if the group contained the
only selected heads. This enables a fan to be simultaneously applied to
groups of different sizes.

Fanning by segments overrides fanning by parts. Fanning by groups
overrides fanning by parts or segments.

The following short-cuts also work:

Hold FAN + press LOCATE. Returns to default FAN type – asymmetric.

Hold FAN + press NEXT HEAD. Chooses next FAN type.

Hold FAN + press PREV HEAD. Chooses previous FAN type.




=== And Only

The AND ONLY (*) function enables selecting of the common heads between
groups. It can be used on pairs of groups or on ranges of groups. When
selecting a number of groups then the * operator can be used to specify
that only the heads that are in both groups are selected.

GROUP 1 * 2 ENTER

This selects heads which are in both groups 1 and 2


And Only can be used with the THRU, + and – operators.

GROUP 1 THRU 4 * 5 THRU 8 ENTER

This select heads which are in one of the groups 1 to 4 and also in one
of the groups 5 to 8.

It is possible to use And Only together with the @ operator to set
levels directly.

GROUP 1 * 3 @ FULL ENTER

Note that if the option “Select heads and palettes from keypad” is set
to “No” – then the * * operator must be used to select groups from the
keypad:

1 * 2 * *

1 THRU 4 * 5 THRU 8 * *

1 * 3 * * @ FULL ENTER
