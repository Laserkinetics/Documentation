== Cue Stacks
MagiQ stores sequence of Cues as Cue Stacks. Cue Stacks keep track
of the order of the cues and the options for how they are played back. A
Cue Stack may have only one Cue associated with it or may have a whole
list of Cues.

When you record a Cue onto a Playback, MagicQ automatically
generates a Cue Stack. MagicQ adds the Cue Stack to the Stack
Store. The Stack Store is a list of all Cue Stacks stored in the show. The Cue Stack will be given a unique Cue Stack Number (e.g.
CS1). This enables the Cue Stack to be re-used in future programming.

If a Playback already has a Cue Stack stored on it, then by default the
new Cue will be added to the end of the Cue Stack. However if you key in
a Cue Id before pressing RECORD then the Cue will be inserted into the
Cue Stack in the appropriate place.

To view a Cue Stack, press the SELECT button of the Playback and then
CUE STACK to open the Cue Stack Window. Alternatively double click the
SELECT button of the Playback.


=== Cue Stack Window

The Cue Stack Window shows details of all the Cues in the Cue Stack
including their names, numbers and timing information. The fields can be
edited in a similar way to the Prog Window and Patch Windows.

image:images/cuestackcues.png[image]

The status field indicates the current status of the Cue in the Cue
Stack. If the Cue is active (i.e. it is in the process of execution)
then the field indicates a % complete and the entire cue is coloured
red.

Each Cue within a Cue Stack has a Cue Id (e.g. 1.0). This value is
specific to the Cue Stack and is used for tying up Cues with a script in
theatre style playback. It is distinct from the Cue Number (e.g. Q1)
used to identify the Cue in the Cue Store.

Each Cue also has some text associated with it. This text enables easy
recognition of the contents of the Cue when the Cue Stack is played
back. This text is displayed above the main Playbacks. It can also be
displayed on the displays above the Wing Playbacks.

Soft button A can be used to select different views. The different view
modes show the columns in different orders. View modes include Default,
Info, Macro and Tracking and Media.


=== Chase Timing

When you record more than one Cue onto a Cue Stack, the Cue Stack
behaviour kicks in to control the transition from one Cue to another. By
default the Cue Stack operates like a chase - i.e. each Cue is executed
in turn, with timing being handled by a Chase Speed for the whole Cue
Stack.

The timing mode can be changed, so that the Cues play back in a theatre
style using the GO / STOP buttons, by pressing the CUE TIMING and CHASE
TIMING soft buttons in the Cue Stack View Options Window to modify the
timing mode.


=== Cue Timing

When using Cue Timing, the timing of each cue is determined by
individual Wait, Delay and Fade times for each Cue in the Cue Stack. The
MagicQ can execute multiple Cues at one time - for example a Cue Stack
could have one Cue that fades in MAC500s in green whilst another Cue
fades in HPEs in red.

The Wait time affects when execution of the Cue is started. The Delay
and Fade times affect how each individual Cue is executed. The Wait time
can be set to "Follow" - in this case the Cue is executed when the last
Cue finishes - i.e. Cues are executed sequentially.

Each Cue has a Next Cue - by default this is set up to be the following
Cue in the Cue Stack. You can change the Next Cue to be any of the Cues
in the Cue Stack. This enables loops and sequences to be set up.

The Next Cue for the last Cue in the Cue Stack defaults to being the
first Cue in the Cue Stack.

==== Cue Timing Example

To illustrate the above Cue Timing consider a Cue Stack with three Cues.
When the Cue Stack starts executing it executes the first Cue using its
Delay and Fade times.

As soon as the first Cue has been started (regardless of whether the
first Cue is in a Delay, Fade or Complete stage) the next Cue in the Cue
Stack will be examined to determined its Wait time.

If the Halt field on the next Cue is set, then the Cue Stack waits for
Go to be pressed before starting the next Cue – otherwise it executes
the next Cue using its Fade and Delay time. The picture below shows 3
Cues each set to follow the previous Cue but with “Halt” set to “Yes”.

image:images/cuestackcues.png[image]

If the Wait time on the next Cue is set to “Follow” then the Cue Stack
will wait until the first Cue has completely finished fading (i.e. all
channels have reached their final values) before starting the next Cue.

If the Wait time on the next Cue is set to a time then the Cue Stack
waits that time before executing the next Cue. This time is completely
independent of the first cue – the first cue may still be in Delay or
Fade and will continue until the Fade completes.

If you enter a wait time in the Wait field MagicQ automatically changes
the Halt field to No so that the

Cue executes after the specified Wait time. The picture below shows Cues
2.00 and 3.00 automatically running 1 second and 2 seconds after Cue
1.00.

image:images/cuestackwaittimes.png[image]

==== The Halt field

This field determines whether MagicQ waits for the user to press GO
before executing the next Cue. It can also be use to setup Cue triggers
from the remote interface, Scheduled events or timecode.

Pressing ENTER only toggles between Yes and No. To get the advanced
options, such as Timecode, Scheduled or Remote either double click the
field or press SHIFT + ENTER.


==== Cue Delay and Fade times

The Delay and Fade times shown in the Cue Stack Window are properties of
the Cue whilst the Wait time is a property of the Cue Stack. Modifying
the Delay and Fade times of the Cue may affect other Cue Stacks that use
the Cue.

The Delay and Fade time fields show the maximum delay and fade times
used by any channel within the Cue – so giving a summary of the maximum
delay and fade of the Cue. To view the actual times of the Cue move the
cursor to the Delay or Fade field and press the View Cue soft button.
This opens the Cue Window for the selected Cue, automatically showing
the Cue Times.

Delay and fade times can be entered directly in the Cue Stack Window –
note however that this will set the times for all attributes. If you
wish to change just the times for Position, Beam or Colour then these
should be set up in the Cue Window, Simple View for general times or Cue
Window, Advanced View for channel specific times.

Split intensity in/out times can be entered into the Cue Stack Window in
the Delay and Fade fields using /. For example, 2/3 entered in the Fade
field will produce an in fade of 2 seconds and an out fade of 3 seconds.
Only intensities times are affected – Beam, Colour and Position times
remain at their current values.

When executing Cues, MagicQ will primarily use the specific delay and
fade times entered in the Advanced View, of the Cue Window. If no times
are specified, then the general times used in the Simple View will be
used.

Times can be added in the Advanced View using the keypad and can be
removed using the REMOVE button. In the Advanced View, the times shown
are fade times, except where delay times have been set up, then times
are shown as delay/fade.

Times can also be set up for the selected heads in the Simple View.

In the Cue Stack and Cue Windows delay and fade times with a ‘>’ symbol
at the end indicate when there are advanced times set for the Cue.


=== Tracking

By default MagicQ works in a similar way to most traditional
lighting consoles, in that what is in the programmer is recorded into
the Cue. This is a "no nonsense" mode where you get what you expect
recorded into your Cues.

If you program just a FX chase on pan and tilt into a Cue, then that is
what you get. If you program a complete look for a head including all
the attributes, then that is what you get. Looking at a Cue in the Cue
Window gives you the full picture.

In a Cue Stack, you can choose for each Cue whether the Playback
continues to control HTP and LTP channels used earlier in the Cue Stack
but not stored in the current Cue. In “Normal Mode” the LTP
channels are tracked, but HTP channels (Intensities) are not.

Traditionally lighting consoles used tracking mode to reduce show storage by only recording changes into each Cue.  This can be confusing as when you jump
around in Cue Stacks they may not play back as they were programmed.  Busking live shows can be particularly difficult, as it can be more
difficult to predict what is going to happen.

MagicQ show files do not require a significant amount of space compared to the storage space available so show size is not a major concern. MagicQ has powerful editing modes that enable changes to be made to multiple Cues
simultaneously – overcoming any benefits tracking mode might have for storing Cues in separate parts.

The MagicQ supports a tracking mode, which can be turned on through View Settings in the Setup Window. We recommend that users unfamiliar with tracking use MagicQ in its default, “non tracking”
mode.


==== Tracking on MagicQ

The easiest way to change between tracking and non tracking is to change
the “Programming Mode” by pressing soft button B in the Setup Window
and choosing one of the modes – Normal, Theatre Non-Tracking, Theatre
Tracking or Hog II Warp.

Changing the “Programming Mode” affects the “Programmer Tracking” option
in the Setup Window and also the defaults for tracking (“Track”,“Zero
old HTP” , “Zero old FX”, “Rel old chans”) on the Cues Stack options.
The “Programmer Tracking” option by itself determines how Cues are
recorded - it does not affect how they are played back.

When programmer tracking mode is off, then the entire contents of the
programmer is recorded into Cues regardless of whether attributes have
been change since the last Cue was recorded.

When programmer tracking mode is on, then only attributes that have been
modified since the Cue was recorded are stored into the new Cue.
Attributes are determined as modified if their value had been changed
using an encoder, using keypad entry, using a range button, using a
palette or by a locate fixture. Note that modifying an attribute to a
new value and then returning it to its old value counts as modified.

Whilst in programmer tracking mode it is possible to force a record of
the whole of the programmer by selecting the ENTIRE STATE record option.
Record options are configured by pressing SHIFT and RECORD; whereupon
the Record Options window is opened. Pressing any Window select button
hides the display option and returns to the appropriate Window.

image:images/cuestacktrack.png[image]

As a Cue Stack is executed, it keeps track of channels that have been
used in previous Cues but are not used in the current Cue. How these
channels are handled depends on the following settings on each Cue in
the Cue Stack – there are three options which are shown in the Track
field.

H Track HTP (Defaults Yes in tracking mode)

L Track LTP (Defaults Yes in all modes)

F Track FX (Defaults Yes in tracking mode)

So, to get a Cue Stack recorded in tracking mode to track all channel
state during playback, ensure that all the Cue Stack steps have HLF set
in the Track field.

If Track LTP is not set then LTP channels that were used in previous
steps in the Cue Stack but not in the current step are released with the
release time of the Cue Stack. If Track HTP is not set then HTP channels
that were used in previous steps in the Cue Stack but not in the current
step are faded out using the Intensity fade out time of that Cue step.

In addition there is an option on the Cue Stack that affects how
tracking works for jumps and going backwards up the Cue Stack. If
"recalculate state on jumps” is set, then MagicQ recalculates the entire state of the
Cue Stack when you jump to a new Cue using "Goto Cue" or if you press
the Pause button to go backwards up the Cue Stack.


==== Viewing Cue Data and Tracking Data

The Cue Window shows the Cue data for the current Cue on the selected
Playback. The Cue Window, has three views, View Levels, View Times and View
FX just like the Programmer Window.

When looking at a Cue Stack in the Cue Stack Window it is possible to go
directly to the Cue Window by placing the cursor on the required Cue and
pressing the View Cue soft button. If the field the cursor is on is a
timing field then the Cue Window will open to show View Times, otherwise
it will open to show View Levels.

It is possible to view Cue data for different Cues in a Cue Stack by
pressing the PREV CUE and NEXT CUE soft buttons. When a Cue is examined
that is not the current Cue on the selected Playback, the Cue Window
becomes locked to that Cue. Press the UNLOCK WINDOW soft button to
return to viewing the current Cue.

The Cue Window can also be used to preview Cues when in tracking modes –
there is a View Tracking soft button. When this option is on the Window
shows all of the values that are tracking from previous Cues as well as
the data in the selected Cue. The tracked data is shown in dark colour
whereas the data from the selected Cue is shown in active colours.

When running a Cue Stack it is possible to determine which values have
been tracked through the Cue Stack by selecting “View Cue Ids” in the
Outputs Window. This shows which playback and which Cue on that playback
is controlling the outputs. Thus, when values are tracking through a Cue
Stack the Outputs Window will show the Cue that originated that value.


==== Copying Cues in tracking mode

When in tracking mode, performing an unlinked copy of a Cue in a Cue
Stack now copies the entire state of the Cue, not just the specific cue
values. When copying multiple Cues from one Cue Stack to another Cue
Stack, the first Cue will be copied entire state with the following cues
being just the changes.

If Cues are copied linked in tracking mode then they will always be just
the change values not the entire state.

When using Theatre Tracking mode, Hog II Warp mode and Film mode, MagicQ
defaults the Cue Storage option “Copy mode (unlinked/linked) to
“unlinked”.



==== Blocking / Unblocking Cues

In tracking mode it is possible to block and unblock Cues from the Cue
Stack Window and from the Cue Window through soft buttons.

Blocking a Cue has the effect of adding to that Cue all the state
information that would track through into that Cue if the Cue Stack was
executed up to and including that Cue. When a Cue is blocked it becomes
a hard Cue – i.e. if edits are made to previous Cues then the edits will
not affect the blocked Cue.

Unblocking a Cue has the effect of removing from the Cue all the state
information that would track through into that Cue if the Cue Stack was
executed up to and including that Cue. When a Cue is unblocked it
removes any hard values in the Cue – therefore it enables values to
track through from where they were first used.

Unblocking and blocking Cues in a Cue Stack does not affect the
appearance of the Cues and Cues Stacks when the Cue Stack is played back
– it simply affects where the data is stored and what effect an edit
will have on a Cue.

Multiple Cues can be blocked / unblocked in the Cue Stack Window by
selecting a range using SHIFT and the cursor keys.


=== Cue Only

The “Cue Only” function in the Cue Stack Window can be used to mark a
Cue as a temporary change to the lighting state before continuing the
tracked state from the following Cue. The Cue Only field is on the right
hand side of the Cue Stack Window (page right) and is only relevant when
using tracking mode.

MagicQ enables one or more Cues to be marked as Cue Only – when MagicQ
moves on to the next Cue which is not set to “Cue Only” then it reverts
to tracking the Cue Stack from before the “Cue Only” cues.

Note that sequential Cues marked “Cue Only” will each be based on the
state previous to the first “Cue Only” Cue with the additions of the
specific Cue. To track changes through a sequence of “Cue Only” Cues,
record each Cue using “Entire State” to capture the entire programmer
contents in to each “Cue Only” Cue.


=== Mark Cues

Mark Cues are special cues that are used to pre-load LTP values before
the following Cue is executed thus ensuring that, for instance, moving
heads are in the correct position before the Cue executes. Note that
Mark Cues only take effect if the corresponding head has intensity set
to 0 – otherwise the change would be noticeable.

The Mark Cue only affects LTP values for heads controlled by the Cue
Stack which are currently at zero intensity. If these heads are used in
the next Cue then their value will be faded to the value of the next
Cue. By default the fade is set to 3 seconds but this can be modified as
required. Note that attributes that are specified as Instant in the
personality file will snap to the new value.

The Mark Cue executes as soon as the previous Cue has completed
execution.

In the Cue Stack Window press the Mark Cue soft button insert a Mark Cue
before the Cue which the cursor is currently on. Alternatively enter a
Cue Id and press Mark Cue to insert a mark before the specified Cue Id.

An entire Cue Stack can be configured to automatically perform the
function of marking all Cues - set the Move When Dark option in View
Options in the Cue Stack Options.

When using Marking and Move When Dark attributes of moving lights will be marked even if they have not
been previously used in the Cue Stack.  This result is that when a Mark Cue is executed in
a Cue Stack, MagicQ will take control of the parameters used in the
Marked Cue from other Cue Stacks even though the Cue is not yet
executed.

=== The Cue Store and Cue Stack Store

MagicQ stores Cues and Cue Stacks in the Cue Store and Cue Stack
Store respectively. Since you can program Cues and Cue Stacks directly
onto playbacks, it is possible to program complete shows without
referring to the Cue Store or the Cue Stack Store.

However, sometimes you may wish to build up a library of Cues or Cue
Stacks that are not assigned to playbacks. You might then assign them to
playbacks later, e.g. during a technical rehearsal.

To record a Cue into the Cue Store simply set up the required look in
the programmer, open the Cue Store Window, press RECORD and press an
empty Cue in the Cue Store Window.

To record a Cue into a Cue Stack in the Cue Stack Store Window set up
the look as above, open the Cue Store Window, press RECORD and press the
Cue Stack you wish to record the Cue into. If the Cue stack is empty
then a new Cue Stack will be generated. Otherwise the Cue will be added
to the existing Cue Stack, either at the specified Cue Id, or at the end
of the Cue Stack.

You can test programmed Cues and Cue Stacks in the Cue Store and Cue
Stack Store by pressing the appropriate Cue or Cue Stack. MagicQ
searches for an unused playback (from the last playback down) to test
the Cue on. Pressing the Cue or Cue Stack again removes the Cue or Cue
Stack from the playback.

You can restart a Cue or Cue Stack that is being tested by pressing the
"Retest" soft button. Holding CTRL and selecting a Cue or Cue Stack also
restarts the Cue / Cue Stack.

You can view the contents of a programmed Cue by moving he cursor to the
required Cue in the Cue Store Window and pressing the View Cue soft
button. This opens the Cue Window locked to the specified Cue. Pressing
the Unlock Cue button returns the Cue Window to monitoring the current
Cue on the currently selected playback.

You can view the contents of a programmed Cue Stack by moving he cursor
to the required Cue Stack in the Cue Stack Store Window and pressing the
View Stack soft button. This opens the Cue Stack Window locked to the
specified Cue Stack. Pressing the Unlock Stack button returns the Cue
Stack Window to monitoring the Cue Stack on the currently selected
playback.

Note that the Cue Id used as a sequence number in the Cue Stack (e.g.
1.00) is different to the QId used in the Cue Store (e.g. Q5). The Cue
Id is the sequence number within the Cue Stack wheras the QId is the
reference number in the Cue Store.

Some users prefer to hide the QId and only use and view Cue Ids – use
the Setup, Cue Storage Settings – “Hide Cue Store Ids (Qxxx). When this
option is set the Cue Stack window and Cue Window only either show the
Cue Ids from within the Cue Stack – they do not show the Q ids from the
Cue Store.


=== Assigning Cues and Cue Stacks

Cues and Cue Stacks can be assigned to Playbacks at any time.

To assign a Cue, open the Cue Store Window, press the MOVE button,
select a Cue, and then select a playback to assign the Cue to. You can
assign to real playbacks or to playbacks in the Playbacks Window. You
can assign to a specific Cue Id in a Cue Stack on a playback, by keying
in a Cue Id before you select the playback.

To assign a Cue Stack, open the Cue Stack Store Window, press the MOVE
button, select a Cue Stack, and then select an empty playback to assign
the Cue to. You can assign to real playbacks or to playbacks in the
Playbacks Window.

Multiple Cues and Cue Stacks can be assigned at a time, by using SHIFT
or CTRL and the cursor keys to select multiple Cues and Cue Stacks in
the appropriate window.


=== Copying and Moving Cues

Cues can be copied and moved within a Cue stack using the standard move
and copy procedures. For example, to move a cue, press COPY, select the
source, then select the destination. To copy multiple cues, press and
hold COPY, select multiple entries, release COPY and select the
destination.

When copying or moving within a Cue Stack, Cues the Cues are moved or
copied before the destination Cue that you select. To copy or move onto
the end of the Stack select "End" as the destination.

Cues can be copied onto other Cue Stacks that are assigned to playbacks.
Select the Cues in the Cue Stack window and then select a playback fader
as the destination.

By default when copying Cues MagicQ does not create new Cues - it
simply makes another link to the existing Cue. To force MagicQ to
create a new Cue press SHIFT and COPY.


=== Linked Cues

Cues that are used more than once in a Cue Stack or that are used in
more than one Cue Stack are called Linked Cues. If you edit a linked cue
it will affect all places where the Cue is used. The Cue Store Window
shows where each cue is used.

In Cue Stacks linked Cues are shown with a “L” in the Cue field. It is
possible to unlink a Cue by moving to the Cue in the Cue Stack and
pressing SHIFT and UNLINK CUE.

If you wish to avoid creating linked Cues, then when copying Cues and
Cue Stacks use SHIFT + COPY (copy unlinked) rather than COPY.


=== Removing Cues and Cue Stacks

Cues can be removed from a Cue Stack by opening the Cue Stack window,
then pressing REMOVE and selecting the Cue you wish to remove by
pressing in the “Status or Cue Id” field.

It is also possible to remove a specific Cue from a Cue Stack using the
keypad. Type a Cue Id on the keypad then press REMOVE and select the S
button of the Playback you wish to remove the Cue from.

To remove an entire Cue Stack from a Playback press REMOVE and hit the S
button of the Playback. Press S button again to confirm.

Note that the Cue Storage Setting in the Setup options determine whether
the Cue and Cue Stack are removed from the Cue Store and Cue Stack Store
as well.


=== Cue Stack Defaults

The default operation of Cue Stacks can be modified in the Defaults view
of the Cue Stack Window.

Defaults can be configured for all of the Cue Stack options including
operation of the faders and buttons, chase defaults and the defaults for
each Cue Stack step.

Changing the Defaults does not change Cue Stacks and Cues which have
already been recorded – it only changes the options for when new Cue
Stacks and Cues are recorded.

When inserting and adding Cues to a Cue Stack MagicQ by default derives the
settings from the previous Cue in the Cue Stack.  If the setting Setup, Cue Storage Settings, “Derive settings from previous Cue” is set to "No" then all new recorded Cues will use the default step settings.


=== Audio Sound FX Cues

MagicQ supports playback of audio files triggered from Cues within Cue Stacks for playing back sound effects in theatre shows and for playing back Cue Calls.  Users place audio files in the audio folder and then can select them directly from the Cue Stack.  Multiple audio files can be played at the same time and the audio volume can be configured.

In the Cue Stack use Encoder A to select View Mode to Media to choose and view the audio clip for each Cue step.


=== Cue Stack Macros

Cue Stack macros enable control over other Cue Stacks from within Cue
Stacks such as activation, release, go, stop, and setting level of other
Cue Stacks. Macros are typed into the Macro field in the Cue Stack
window (scroll to the right). Macros can affect multiple Cue Stacks on
different Playbacks enabling complete shows to be driven from one master
Cue Stack.

Cue Stack macros take the following format:

|=====
|A <Playback no>|Activate playback
|B <Macro no>|Run macro
|R <Playback no>|Release playback (0 = release this playback)
|T < Playback no>|Test playback (activate with level 100%)
|U <Playback no>|Un-test playback (release with level 0%)
|G <Playback no>|Go on playback.
|G <Playback no> / <Cue id>|Go to Cue id on playback.
|H <Type>|1 – Lamp on all heads, 2 reset all heads, 3 lamp off all heads,
4 cancel screen save
|H <Type> / <zone> |Type is 5 for enable zone, 6 for disable zone
|S <Playback no>|Stop playback
|C <Playback no>|Choose playback
|K <Level>|Set level of last Cue Stack to be activated (e.g. with an A
command)
|L <Level>|Set level of current playback
|M <Level>|Set level of the playback that is running the macro
|J <Cue Id>|Jump to Cue Id on current playback
|E <Cue Stack id>|Activates Cue Stack (in Stack Store).
|E <Cue Stack is>/<level>|Activate Cue Stack at level.
|F <Cue Stack id>|Releases Cue Stack (in Stack Store)
|I <Time code>|Set internal time code
|O <Time code>|Set current received time code
|P <Page no>|Change page (page no of 0 means next page)
|V <View no>|Open view (window layout)
|W <Enable>|Enable / disable time code generation (1 for enable, 0 for
disable)
|Q <Time code>|Set current time code (used for time code generation)
|======

Playbacks can be the master playbacks 1 to 10 or the wing playbacks 1-1
to 1-24, 2-1 to 2-24 etc…Playbacks can be playbacks with faders or
virtual playbacks (playbacks on non fitted wings). Multiple playbacks
can be selected using + and THRU.

For example to activate playback 18 on wing 1,

A1-18

To press GO on playbacks 3 to 5,

G3THRU5

Multiple commands can be put in a Cue Stack macro, e.g. to set the level
of playback 6 to 60%

C6L60


When setting Cues to Timecode for the first time, the initial Timecode
value is set to the last Timecode value in the Cue Stack + 1 second.

Added new Cue Stack macro syntax for releasing the playback that is
running the macro – the R macro now supports the parameter 0 to release
itself – i.e. R0.

The G macro optionally supports two parameters separated by a /. The
first parameter is the playback, the second is the Cue ID to GO. For
example, G5/6 will GO Cue Id 6 on Playback 5.

=== Timeline

MagicQ supports a Timeline Window for viewing the contents of Cues in
a Cue Stack in a timeline format. Open the Timeline Window using the
Timeline Button.

Use encoders A to specify the level of detail shown for each head and
encoder B to choose specific attribute masks.

Encoder D is used to modify the horizontal scale to choose how many Cue
Steps are shown in the window.

Use encoders X and Y to scroll around the timeline.

By default all of the heads in the Cue Stack on the selected Playback
are shown – use the SEL HDS ONLY soft button to make it only show the
currently selected heads from that Playback.

View Vals and View Raw can be used to view the data values rather than
the timeline.
