== Patching
=== Patching on MagicQ

MagicQ considers DMX and console channels to be the same and therefore there is no need for complex
patching to be carried out before the console can be used.  MagicQ allows access to all DMX channels on all DMX universes supported on the console. Each channel can be controlled and
programmed independently.

Each head can be allocated a head number for recall using the keypad and
a name for identification. However to save time, MagicQ will
automatically allocate numbers and names according to head types.


=== Getting started with patching

MagicQ supports comprehensive patching facilities for allocating
dimmers and intelligent heads to DMX channels. Patching can be carried
out at any time and has an immediate effect.

Press the PATCH button to open the Patch Window. The Patch Window has
four views, VIEW HEADS, VIEW CHANS, VIEW DMX and VIEW VIS.

VIEW HEADS is used to patch heads, name and number then and set and gel colour.

VIEW CHANS is used to carry out operations on individual DMX channels,
such as testing the channel and setting inverts.

VIEW DMX is used when patching more than one DMX channel a MagicQ dimmer.

VIEW VIS is used for setting up and modifying visualiser heads in the MagicVis visualiser.


=== Patching a Head or Dimmer

MagicQ supports a large library of heads. MagicQ treats
dimmers just like any other head - they just happen to have a single
channel. Dimmers use the "Generic Dimmer" personality.

image:images/patchdimmers.png[image]

Choose the head you wish to patch by pressing the CHOOSE HEAD soft
button. The Window will change to give you a list of heads. Select a
head by pressing the touch screen. Alternatively scroll around the
Window using the cursor keys, and press ENTER when the cursor is over
the correct head.

Once you have chosen a head you will be returned to the Patch Window.
Press the PATCH IT soft button to patch the head, and you will be
prompted for an address to patch the head to.

Press ENTER to patch to the next free address – the title bar shows the
next free address that a head of the chosen type can be patched. If you
wish to patch multiple heads at fixed offsets e.g. four Martin Mac500s
at DMX channels 1,21,41,61 then enter 4/20.

image:images/patchit.png[image]

To patch a head at a specific address use @. For example to patch 10
dimmers at DMX address 20 key in 10@20. To patch to the 2^nd^ universe
use mailto:10@2-20[10@2-20]. To patch at the first free address on a
universe other than the first universe use +, e.g. for the second
universe use 10@+2-1.

If this is the first patch you have patched then MagicQ will prompt you
whether to add the head into the visualiser. Pressing yes will create a
visualiser head within the show file, so that you can see the head in
the MagicQ visualiser.

To patch more heads, just repeat the above process.

To patch a dimmer, simply press CHOOSE DIM/MEDIA, select Generic Dimmer,
and then patch one or more dimmers as above.

In the Patch Window all the fields coloured yellow can be configured. To
modify a field, first move the cursor to the field, then input the new
value using the keypad and keyboard, and finally press ENTER.

In this way you can modify DMX address, head number, head name and gel
for each of your patched heads.

=== Head Names and Head Numbers

Press the VIEW HEADS soft button to check the heads you have patched,
and to name and number them as you wish. In the Patch Window all the
light coloured fields can be configured. To modify a field, first move
the cursor to the field, then input the new value using the keypad and
keyboard, and finally press ENTER.

Multiple head names and numbers can be set at the same time by using
SHIFT and the cursor keys to select multiple items. Turning on test mode
using the TEST HEAD soft button makes it easy to view each head / dimmer
in turn.

By default the VIEW HEADS view is sorted by head number. If you are
setting head numbers by entering each head number individually then you
may find it easier if the view is sorted by DMX. Press the SORT soft
button and select BY DMX. Note that the sort also affects the order in
the Intensities Window, the Programmer Window and the Group Window.


==== Head Names

Head names are used to identify the Dimmer or Head. We recommend that you
set the head name based on its location (e.g. front wash / back truss
SL). It is not necessary to name intelligent heads according to their
product name (e.g. Mac500) as this is already stored in the head.

image:images/patchdimmers.png[image]

==== Head Numbers

Head numbers are used in various displays to indicate which heads are
being operated on. Head numbers can also be used for selecting heads and
setting intensities directly from the keypad.

By default MagicQ numbers in the order that they are patched
starting from 1.

If you expect to be selecting heads using the keypad then we recommend
you use unique head numbers for each head. MagicQ uses unique
numbers by default. You can modify head numbers manually so that they
are more meaningful to your rig. Alternatively you can use one of the
in-built renumber algorithms.

Pressing RENUM HEAD NOS and selecting BEST FIT causes MagicQ to use
an intelligent algorithm to allocate heads starting with numbers that
you can easily recall. For example, if you patch 4 MAC500s and 4 HPEs
then when you renumber using BEST FIT it will number the MAC500s from 1
to 4 and the HPEs from 11 to 14.

If you would rather work with DMX channel numbers, then press the RENUM
HEAD NOS soft button and select BY DMX. This will configure the head
number for all patched heads to be the DMX channel address of the head.
You can then select heads and set intensities using the DMX channel
numbers.

Selecting HEADS (ALL START 1) sets the head numbers so that for each
head the numbers start from 1 - this is the default option. Selecting BY
NAME sets the head numbers so that they use head name, gel and type to
order the heads.


==== Patching to specific Head numbers

It is possible to patch direct to a specific head number using the *
operator.

For example:

10 @ 7 – 2 * 201

This will patch 10 heads at channel 2 on Universe 7 starting at head
number 201.


=== Gel name and number

For dimmers you may wish to configure the gel name or number. This makes
programming easier – enabling MagicQ to auto program cues for you.

The gel field uses gel numbers. For Lee colours enter the gel number
directly (e.g. 181 for Lee 181). For Rosco colours enter the gel number
preceded by dot (e.g. .14 for Rosco 14). For no colour enter 0. If you
would prefer to use colour names rather than gel numbers then simply
enter the colour name. MagicQ knows standard colour names.


=== Generating auto groups

MagicQ automatically generates groups for each of the different
heads patched – e.g. “All Dimmers”, “All Mac500”.

MagicQ is also capable of generating groups based on gel colours
and head names. Press the AUTO GROUPS soft button in the VIEW HEADS view
of the Patch Window and then select Dimmers and/or Heads.

When Dimmers are selected MagicQ will examine all dimmers patched
and generate a group for each different gel colour and a group for each
different head name.

When Heads is selected MagicQ will generate a group for each
different head type that has heads with a distinct head name. Thus if
you have named some of your Mac500s “front” and some of them “back” it
will generate a “Mac500 front” group and a “Mac500 back” group.


=== Multi Element Heads

For heads that have multiple attributes of one type – e.g. more than one
dimmer or more than one red, green or blue channel MagicQ uses multi
element heads.

Multi element heads are patched in exactly the same way as normal heads,
but MagicQ shows a * next to the DMX address to indicate that it is a
multi element head.

Multi element heads have a separate head number for each element in the
head – therefore when patching several of these heads, the head numbers
will increase by more than one per head.

MagicQ recognises three kinds of multi element heads – those which
simply have a repeated element, those that have a main element followed
by a repeated element and those that have repeated elements followed by
a main element.

When multi element heads are patched MagicQ generates the “All” group
which contains both the main and repeated elements. MagicQ will also
generate separate groups for the main “Mn” part and the repeated “Ele”
part.

The separate elements of the head can also be sub selected using the dot
operator from the keypad – for example for head 2 you can select 2.4 to
sub select the 4^th^ element.

=== Inverting and Swapping

In VIEW HEADS you can invert the pan and tilt channels of moving heads
and also swap the pan and tilt channels. Pressing ENTER in the
appropriate field changes the field value.

Individual channels can also be inverted in VIEW CHANS if required.


=== Pan and Tilt Offsets

To add a Pan or Tilt offset then enter the offset in degrees in the Pan
offset or Tilt offset in the Patch Window. The offset affects all
programmed values.

=== Applying Offsets using Update

MagicQ supports a quick method of applying an offset to channels such as
a pan or tilt offset, or an offset on a colour scroll.

To apply an offset, playback the Cues and then override only the
parameters you wish to offset in the programmer. Then press the Update
button. The Update options have been modified to include an extra option
“Patch Offset”. Selecting this option applies a permanent offset to the
channel in the Patch rather than modifying the individual Palettes and
Cues.

To remove the offset go to Patch, View Chans and remove the offset from
the appropriate channels.

Offsets apply only to LTP channels, not to HTP (Intensity) channels.

The Outputs window shows channels with offsets in green colour.

The Patch window shows offsets applied to Pan and Tilt in the Pan Offset
and Tilt Offset field.



=== Minimum and Maximum levels

You can set minimum and maximum levels for each patched channel from the
VIEW CHANS view. This is useful for setting pre-heat on dimmers or for
limiting output values of certain lamps where power is tight.

The minimum and maximum levels have absolute over-ride over all other
playback and programming. Master faders and the DBO
button do not affect the minimum and maximum levels.

Minimum levels can be useful to force a minimum light level on a stage,
for example during a changeover.


==== Limits and Offset.

It is possible to set limits and offsets on channels using the Limit and
Offset dimmer curves.

Limit enables a maximum level to be set for the channel whilst retaining
the normal linear dimming curve. When dimmer curve is set to “Limit” the
channel has a linear curve up to the maximum value rather than using the
normal linear curve and then stopping at the maximum value.

Offset enables an offset value to be applied to a channel – this can be
useful if a moving light is not calibrated correctly or it has been
moved. When dimmer curve is set to “Offset” then the minimum value
specifies the offset to be applied. When a channel value exceed 255 then
it wraps back to 0.


=== Dimmer curves

MagicQ supports 10 user dimmer curves that can be selected in the Patch
Window, View Chans view.

User dimmer curves are specified in files of format csv (comma separated
variable) with filename dimmercurveuser1.csv, dimercurveuser2.csv etc…
stored in the show/heads folder.

The files consist of 256 lines each with a value between 0 and 255.
These files can be generated in a spreadsheet (e.g. Microsoft Excel) and
saved as csv format.

image:images/dimmercurve.png[image]

From v1.6.0.7 dimmer curves can have 16bit values (0..66535) instead of
just (0..255). If any value in the user dimmer curve file is over 255
then 16bit is assumed.

User dimmer curves are not stored into the show or settings files. Each
MagicQ system that uses user dimmer curves must have the curves stored in the
show/heads folder.

In the CSV file the line after the last line of data (the 257^th^ line)
can hold a name for the curve which is then displayed in MagicQ. The
name has a maximum of 15 characters.

Dimmer curve files are read on startup of MagicQ – so you will need to
reset MagicQ for new curves to be loaded.


=== Testing channels

To test channels in VIEW CHANS press the TEST CHANS soft button to enter
test mode. In this mode the channel which the cursor is on is set to the
level configured on the TEST CHANS encoder. Use the cursor keys to move
through different channels. Test mode remains active until the TEST
CHANS soft button is pressed again.

Channel testing works for both patched and unpatched channels. Note that
for channels patched as LTP, the level of the Grand Master does not
affect the channel level and after test is turned off the channel
remains at the test level. LTP channels can be set to zero by pressing
CTRL CLEAR.

image:images/channeltest.png[image]

You can also test channels by moving to the appropriate channel and
pressing the TEST SELECT CHANS soft button. The channel will be set to
the level of the Grand Master fader. Pressing TEST SELECT CHANS soft
button again returns the channel to zero. You can test multiple channels
by using SHIFT and the cursor keys to select multiple channels and then
pressing the TEST SELECT CHANS soft button. Channels that are in test
mode are highlighted in red.

Pressing Soft Button A (NEXT UNI or PREV UNI) soft button moves you up or down the
window to the first channel of the next or previous universe.


=== Changing the DMX address of heads

Heads (including Dimmers) can be moved to different DMX addresses as required. When
they are moved all the programming and palettes associated with them
also moves to the new channels.  In Patch, VIEW HEADS simply edit the DMX field with a new address.

If you try and move to a location where there are already channels
patched then MagicQ will prompt whether you wish to continue and
move the already patched channels aside. If you confirm YES the already
patched channels will be moved to the next free locations. If you
confirm NO then no move will be performed.

Multiple heads can be moved at a time using SHIFT and the
cursor keys. When making a change to multiple heads the change defaults
to an absolute change – the first head will be moved to the
specified address and the next heads to the addresses immediately
following. To make a relative change enter a / after the new address -
i.e. to move 4 heads from 1-1 to 2-1, but keeping the relative DMX
offsets between the heads, enter 2-1/. You can also specify an explicit
offset to use, just like when patching e.g. 2-1/20.


=== Patching a Head to multiple DMX addresses

The View DMX view in the Patch Window enables multiple DMX channels to be
easily assigned to one head. Up to 5 additional DMX channels can be set
up for each Head in addition to the main DMX address. Remove additional
channels by pressing REMOVE and selecting the additional channel fields
or by typing “u” (unpatch) instead of a DMX address.

image:images/patchviewdmx.png[image]

=== Unpatching a Head from a DMX address

It is possible to “unpatch” a head – i.e. to remove the association
between the programmed data and a DMX address. The programmed data for
the head is maintained and the head can subsequently be patched to a new
DMX address. To unpatch a head move the cursor to the first DMX field in
View DMX view and press REMOVE, or type “u”.


=== Patching scrollers

There are two ways to patch scrollers – the first method is to patch the
dimmer and scroller separately – then the dimmer and scroller will
operate independently. Use the “generic dimmer” personality for the
dimmer and the “generic scroller” personality for the scroller.

MagicQ has enhanced support for scrollers, so that the colour scroll
channel can be tied up with the dimmer channel in one head.

image:images/patchscrollers.png[image]

To use this support, patch a Generic Scroller With Dim. This will appear
in the View Heads with the DMX address marked as “virtual” and any DMX
address you specified when you patched it will be ignored. Change to the
View DMX view and specify in the appropriate DMX columns the DMX address
of the dimmer and the scroller.

The Generic Scroller With Dim is set up as a “Virtual” personality –
i.e. the channels in the personality can be patched to any location on
MagicQ – unlike normal personalities where the channels are sequential
from the DMX start address. In the View DMX view, the DMX address fields
are used to specify the addresses for each channel in the virtual
personality – up to a maximum of 5 channels. (For normal personalities
these fields are used to specify multiple heads patched to one head.)

=== Editing Heads

You can modify the Head or create a new head in the <<_head_editor,Head Editor>>. Choose the head you wish to edit and
then press the EDIT HEAD soft button.

To quickly choose a head that you have already patched move the cursor to the head in the
Patch Window, hold SHIFT and press CHOOSE HEAD.

To quickly edit a head that you have already patched move the cursor to the head in the
Patch Window, hold SHIFT and press EDIT HEAD.

=== Cloning (Adding extra heads / dimmers to a programmed show)

Cloning enables a show programmed with a certain number of heads to be
expanded to use more of the same head type without having to reprogram
all of the show.

For example, if you have a show programmed with 4 MAC500s and you want
to add 4 more MAC500s, then you can clone the 4 programmed MAC500s. All
the Cues, Cue Stacks, Groups and Palettes that have the original 4
MAC500s will now have the additional 4 MAC500s as well.

By cloning heads in this way you have a quick and easy approach to
expanding your show. You can then programme some new Cues and Cue Stacks
that use the new and old heads individually.

To Clone heads

Enter the Patch Window and choose the 'view heads' view.
Select the heads you wish to clone using SHIFT and the cursor keys. 
Note a new cloned head is created for each of the selected heads. 
e.g. selecting 4 heads when cloning will patch 4 more fixtures each cloned to one of the 4 
selected heads.

Then press the CLONE HEAD soft button.

Cloned heads are patched on the next free universe/channel in MagicQ, these can then be 
re addressed as needed.

There are several options when cloning heads. It is possible to choose
whether both Palettes and Cues are cloned or just Palettes.

It is also possible to specify that FX are split when the heads are
cloned, so that the new heads are part of a different FX from the
original FX. This function should be used with care when cloning
multiple heads in order to avoid fragmenting the F X too much.


==== Copy Head Programming

If you patch new heads into a show, without cloning it is still possible
to then copy programming from other heads to the new heads. To copy
programmed data from one head to another press the SHIFT + COPY HEAD PRG
soft button in the HEAD VIEW, then select the source head followed by
the destination head. All the Cues, Cue Stacks, Groups and Palettes that
contain the source head will be updated to include the destination head.


==== Patch Channel Copy

Another way to expand existing shows is to patch the new heads and
dimmers but then in the Patch window to set a real time channel copy
from another already programmed channel. The value of the channel will
always be that of the already programmed channel. Any programming of the
newly patched channel will be ignored. To set up real time copies, edit
the Merge and From Chan columns in the View Chans view of the Patch
Window. Press ENTER in the Merge column to change it to "Copy" and then
set the From Chan column.


=== Morphing Heads (Changing Head type)

It is possible to morph one head type into another head type. The system
will copy the programming from the old head type to the new head type.
The system takes into account the different pan and tilt ranges of the
heads when copying pan and tilt data.

As no two heads are exactly the same, the programming will not create exactly the same looks as with the original heads. A closer
representation will be obtained by morphing a spot into a spot compared to a spot into a wash light.

If the new head types have more channels than the original head types
then MagicQ morphs the heads but leaves them unpatched – the user must
then repatch the heads at a suitable location.

In the Patch Window, choose the new head type, then move the cursor to
the head to change or select a block of heads using SHIFT and the cursor
keys. Press the MORPH HEAD soft button and confirm that the action is
what is required.

image:images/morph.png[image]

After morphing heads your groups, palettes, and cues will be updated to
reflect the new head types.


==== Morphing Multi Part Heads

From v1.5.1.0 MagicQ supports full morphing between multi part heads,
from single part heads to multi part heads, and from multi part heads to
single part heads.

When morphing between multi part heads, if the new head has less parts
than the original head then the excess parts in the original heads will
be ignored. If the new head has more parts than the original head then
the excess parts in the new head will be a repeat of the parts from the
original head.

This also enables easy changing of mode of multi part heads which was
not previously possible – e.g. when changing a Thomas Pixeline from 18
pixel to 9 pixel mode, or when changing a Chromalec Jarag from 25 to 31
channel mode.


==== Morphing Heads with virtual dimmers

It is possible to morph between heads with inbuilt dimmers and
heads with virtual dimmers. For example it is possible to morph a RGB
head with an inbuilt dimmer to a RGB head with a virtual dimmer.
It is also possible to morph back from a head with a virtual dimmer
to one that has an inbuilt dimmer.


==== Morphing between CMY and colour wheel Heads

When morphing between heads with CMY/RGB and Colour Wheel to heads
with only Colour Wheels, MagicQ now converts the CMY/RGB data to Col
Wheel rather than trying to map between the Colour Wheels. This ensures
that shows programmed with Cues using RGB palettes morph to Col Wheel
palettes.

When morphing to heads with greater number of colour wheels or greater
number of gobo wheels MagicQ now includes the extra colour or gobo
wheels channels in Palettes and Cues where the colour wheels or gobo
wheels were previously used. This enables easy updating of shows, for
example when changing from heads with only 1 gobo wheel to heads
with 2 gobo wheels.


=== Importing Heads

A quick way of patching heads is to import the heads from a file. MagicQ supports comma separated variable files (.csv)
which can be generated from most spread sheets and word processors.

The first row of the file indicates which columns are present in the
file. The next rows of the file contain the data for each head.

Headno,Headname,Dmxno,Headtype,Gel,Pinv,Tinv,Swap
0001,Spots,1-001,Generic Dimmer,No col,no,no,no
0002,Spots,1-002,Generic Dimmer,No col,no,no,no
0003,Spots,1-003,Generic Dimmer,No col,no,no,no
0004,Spots,1-004,Generic Dimmer,No col,no,no,no
0005,Finger L,1-005,Generic Dimmer,R59 Indigo,no,no,no
0006,Finger L,1-006,Generic Dimmer,R312 Canary,no,no,no
0007,Finger L,1-007,Generic Dimmer,R356 Middle Lavender,no,no,no
0008,Finger L,1-008,Generic Dimmer,R27 Medium Red,no,no,no

=== Exporting Heads

The patched heads can be exported using the same file format as used for
import. This file can then be read by a standard spread sheet or word
processor. Patch lists can then be printed.

=== VL5 type channels (split personalities)

MagicQ supports heads such as the Vari-lite VL5^TM^ where the head
functionality is split between different non-contiguous DMX addresses.

The personality for the main channels in the head includes the extra
channels. The extra channels are then patched separately and set to have
their levels copied from the main channels.

For example for a VL5, patch the VL5 to the required DMX address for the
main head. This will include a dummy dimmer channel. 

In Patch, View DMX set the address of the real dimmer channel in the second DMX field.

image:images/patchvl5.png[image]


=== Merging with DMX input

MagicQ supports comprehensive merging of data from each of the
input and output universes. Any output channel can be set to output data
from any received input channel, or to merge the two.

In addition channels can be configured so that they are passed through
transparently unless MagicQ is controlling the channel from the
programmer or a playback. This provides a powerful over-ride mode.

To set a channel to output data received as input from another channel
set the Merge field to “Input” and the From field to the channel number
you wish to get the data from.

You can easily set up a large number of channels by using SHIFT and the
cursor keys to select multiple channels.

You can also set up a channel so that it outputs data from an input
channel except when that channel is being controlled by a playback or
the programmer. Set the Merge field to “Over”.

To HTP merge the output with the received input use the “Merge“
option.

The “Mult” option enables another channel on the console to control the
level of the output of the channel- this is useful with RGB LED heads
where you wish to make another channel control the overall level of the
RGB.

The “Mul-In” option multiplies the received input with the calculated value
for the channel. MagicQ can therefore be used as a DMX modifier to
modify the level of individual or groups of channels.

It is possible to set multiple channels all to copy or multiply by one
channel. Use SHIFT and the cursor keys to select all the required
channels and enter <chan> / 0.


=== Customising Locate, Default, Highlight and Lowlight values

MagicQ allows the user to define the Locate, Default, Highlight and
Lowlight values for each attribute of each patched heads.

The Locate values are the values that are used when the Locate button is
pressed. The Default values are the values that are output when a
channel is not in the programmer and no playback is controlling a
channel. Note that the Setup Window option “Unused chans return to defaults" must be enabled for this mode of operation.

The Hightlight and Lowlight values are used when Highlight Mode is set
to one of the Advanced modes.

By default, the Locate values and Default values are taken from the
personality of the patched head – these typically put the position to
centre, beam open, colour white and intensity at full.

These values can be re-programmed by creating a Cue that represents the
desired Locate Values and/or a Cue that represents the desired Default
Values. For Highlight and Lowlight create a Cue that represents the
desired Highlight or Lowlight values.

Simply record a Cue into the Cue Store and then press the SET LOC CUE,
SET DEF CUE, SET HIGHL CUE, SET LOWL CUE soft buttons. The Cue is
indicated as Default, Locate, Highlight or Lowlight by a D, L,H or Lo
after the Q number.

image:images/defaultcue.png[image]

Only one Cue can be set for each type - however one cue can be set for
more than one type – e.g. one Cue can be set for both the Default Cue
and the Locate Cue.

It is not necessary to program all the different attributes into the
Locate, Default, Highlight or Lowlight Cues. Simply program the values
that you want to be different from normal operation. For instance to
record a default position with all heads positioned towards FOH
position, simply record a Cue with the FOH position data and press the
SET DEF CUE soft button.

If you wish to change the Locate, Default, Highlight or Lowlight Cue
then simply re-record the Cue. If you update Palettes used in the Cue,
or modify the Cue directly from the Cue Window then you may need to
reset the Cue in the Cue Store before the change takes place. Press the
CLEAR DEF CUE and SET DEF CUE for the desired Cue.


=== Theatre Patch syntax

MagicQ supports a Theatre Patch option which changes the syntax used for
patching to simplify patching (and re-patching) of large numbers of
dimmers.

The option is enabled in Setup,View Settings, Keypad, Keypad Syntax
Theatre Patch. When this option is set to “yes” the keypad can be used
to patch a dimmer or moving light directly to a DMX address and head
number – e.g.

10 @ 2 – 5 will patch head number 10 to Universe 2 channel 5.



=== Virtual Dimmers

MagicQ enables LED and other heads with colour mixing but no dimmer
channel to have an associated virtual dimmer. This allows the LED
heads to be used as simple RGB fixtures with a dimmer. This
development does not affect the internal pixel mapping (Bitmap FX) which
already has a virtual dimmer.

To add a virtual dimmer channel for a LED head (i.e. a head
without a dimmer) simply patch a generic dimmer and set the head number
to the same head number as the LED head. The generic dimmer will then
be shown with a ‘v’ after the head number to indicate the association
with the LED fixture. The LED head will then appear with a dimmer in
the Intensity, Group, Outputs and Programmer windows.

Note that virtual dimmers will only work if there are only 2 heads
with the same head number – if there are more than 2 heads with the
same head number then each head will be treated as a separate head.

When MagicQ assigns a virtual dimmer in this way, in the Cue Engine it
takes the value of the RGB (CMY) attributes from the playbacks and
programmer and then scales these values according to the value of the
virtual dimmer channel.

Virtual Dimmers take effect at the Patch level rather than at the
Programmer level. This means that the Output Window, View Heads will
show the virtual levels on the RGB channels (i.e. the RGB levels before
the virtual dimmer is applied).

The Outputs Window, View Chans, View DMX will show the actual levels
output to the RGB channels (i.e. the level after the virtual dimmer is
applied).

The full head can be selected using the head number. The title bar of
the Group, Pos, Colour, Beam windows will show +v for each head with a
virtual dimmer.


==== Quickly adding Virtual Dimmers to patched heads

It is possible to add virtual dimmers to a head in the Patch, View Heads
view using a single action. Place the cursor on the head you wish to add
a virtual dimmer for and then press SHIFT and ADD VDIM. You can use
SHIFT + the cursor keys to select multiple heads.

Virtual dimmers can only be added to heads that do not have an intensity
channel. For heads with multiple RGB elements, a virtual dimmer will be
made for each RGB element.

Virtual dimmers added in this way will appear unpatched. Note that virtual dimmers take up channels from the total channel count.

==== Heads always with virtual dimmers

It is possible to make heads that automatically patch a virtual dimmer.
In the Head Editor, View General, Options there is an option "Virtual
Dim". If this is set to "yes" and the head has no dimmer then a virtual
dimmer is automatically patched for this head.

The MagicQ head library includes a mode of LED3chan with a virtual
dimmer.

Note that Virtual Dimmer is distinct from Virtual Channels where all the
channels of the head have separate DMX addresses.


=== Patch Head Filtering

In Patch, Choose Head it is possible to filter personalities by type, making it easier to find the personalities required.  Filter options include All, Patched, Live, Club, Film/TV and User.

Patched enables users to see which heads are patched in the current show and to re choose them easily.

Users can tag heads that they use frequently so that they appear in the User filter.  This could be used for example to include all heads in the stock of a rental company.

Heads can be tagged and untagged in both Choose Head, Simple View and Choose Head, Adv View.  In Simple View you can tag all heads from a particular manufacturer, or all modes of a specific head.  In Adv View you can tag individual modes of a head.

In Adv View the Tag column shows a "U" for all heads tagged as user.

MagicQ stores a file of all tagged heads in the heads folder called userheads.csv.  It is possible to create or edit this file with a text editor/spreadsheet.  The format is:

<manufacturer> , <short name> , <mode>
