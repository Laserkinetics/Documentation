== Software Upgrade

MagicQ software versions are fully compatible and show files can be created and loaded into any software version.


=== Changing MagicQ Console Software

MagicQ consoles store all versions of software that have been loaded onto the console allowing easy changing between different versions.  To change software version go to Setup, View System, View Status, Change Software.  It is also possible to enter the software utility by pressing ENTER during boot up when prompted to enter the software upgrade utility.

To upgrade to a new version of software, download the software file from ChamSys web site and store it onto a USB stick.

|Pro 2010|.cdx
|pre Pro, Expert, rack mount| .cde (versions 1.5.6.0 and above not supported)
|===

Ensure you have saved your current show file to a USB memory stick or to an external computer via network before you change software version.  Also, ensure any personalities that you have customised have been saved to a different file name of your choice - the new software will install the latest version of the standard personalities.  We recommend you only upgrade to new versions of software when you have plenty of time to recover the system - we don't recommend you change it two minutes before doors!

On the MagicQ console select Setup, File Manager and change to USB DRIVE.  Click on the software version and it will automatically upgrade the console.

It is also possible to copy the software directly via networking to the
magicq folder on the MagicQ console and then to click on the file in
File Manager, HARD DRIVE.

In case of a problem where MagicQ can not be started or where it resets
then the software upgrade utility can be entered on start up, by
pressing a key when prompted on the screen.

=== Upgrading Console Kernel 

The latest version of the Linux kernel available for Pro 2014 systems is currently 3.2.9+ (4th June)

This kernel update brings in a few updates for support of the Edimax USB wifi adapter.
Installation

==== Kernel Install

Before installing the kernel, you must first disable the WiFi adapter from within MagicQ.  Failure to do so
could cause the system to not fully reboot

* In Setup, View Settings, Network, set Wireless Mode to "Disabled".
* Reboot the console fully with the WiFi disabled.
* Confirm that the WiFi adapter is still disabled by checking the Wireless Mode setting is still
configured as Disabled
* Download the kernel update file from http://download.magicq.co.uk/download_file.php?type=doc&file_id=94
* Copy it to a USB stick keeping the same file name
* Insert the USB stick into the console
* In Setup open the File Manager and select View USB
* Locate the kernel installer file and press the COPY button, then click on the file. The command
window should then say "Select Destination"
* Select View HDD softbutton, then click on the box with a single dot in it. This will copy the file
to your hard drive.
* Once the file has copied, stay in the file manager window, and click on the installer file.
* A prompt will appear asking you if you want to upgrade the kernel. Select yes.
* MagicQ will then install the new kernel upgrade to the console then will load MagicQ up again.
* To complete the installation of the kernel, you will have to shut downa and restart the console.
* Once restarted, go to Setup, View Status, View System, System tab, and check the status of "Kernel Version" is the latest version
* Once the new version of the kernel has been installed, you can go back to the WiFi adpater
settings and configure this as usual.

=== Kernel Recovery

If the console gets stuck at "Waiting for nfsd" when booting, then there was an issue with the network
configuration script.

* Turn the power off on the console, and start up with an external keyboard attached to the
system.
* If you have a USB keyboard, you may need to enable USB keyboard support in the BIOS.  Press the delete key repeatedly when the system is starting up to enter the BIOS
setup.  Use the arrow keys and enter key to select Integrated Peripherals, Onboard.  Select Device, USB Keyboard Support and set it to Enabled.  Press F10 to save and exit
* As soon as you power the console on, press the ESC key on the keyboard repeatedly. Insteadof MagicQ booting, a new screen should show up saying GNU GRUB with a list of different
kernel versions.
* Use the arrow keys to select the top option "MagicQ Recovery" and then press Enter.
* The console should then start to boot again, and ask a password. Contact ChamSys support to get the password for your system here.
* You should see some more console output on the screen and then stop with a message of "Give Root Password for maintenance" near the end of the output.
* Enter the second password given to you by ChamSys Support here, then you should then get a prompt which looks like: 

Chamsys176:-#recovering network configuration

If the network configuration is invalid and is stopping the console from starting then you will need to edit the network interface configuration file.  Type:

nano /etc/network/interfaces

You should see several lines at the bottom with things like "Help" "Writeout" "Read file" and a bar at the top starting with "GNU nano". This
file is likely to be blank if the console isn't starting up correctly or will have some lines at the end which mention wireless configuration

If the file is blank, then you can just type in here now to enter the default configuration into the file. Copy the following lines into the file:

auto lo
iface lo inet loopback
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
address 2.9.200.197
netmask 255.0.0.0

If the file already has the above text in it, but with wireless configuration at the bottom, use the arrow keys to goto the first line which says "auto wlan0", then press F9 on the keyboard to delete each line after and
including that, so the content of the file should be left with just the lines above.  Press control then X to close the program, then press Y to confirm you want to save the changes, and
then hit enter to confirm the filename you want to write them to.  To restart the console safely, and let it boot normally type:

init 6


==== Recovering "No more processes left in this runlevel"

If MagicQ fails to boot with the message "No More processes left in this runlevel" then it is likely that the upgrade has not completed correctly.  The may occur if the power has been removed before the hard drive has had time to write all the data.

Connect an external keyboard to the console over USB or PS2.

Enter the recovery mode on the console by pressing the up arrow key repeatedly on the external keyboard, just after powering on the console.

After a while, you should see a blue screen with "GRUB" written at the top. If not, use the white button on the back to reset the console and try again. It sometimes takes a couple of times to get into this mode if you accidentally miss it the first time around.
Once in this prompt, use the arrow keys to select the top item called "Recovery" and hit enter. It should continue to boot and then ask you for a password. Contact ChamSys support for the password.

Then enter the following commands (NOTE: spacing and capitalisation are very important here so double check every command before you run it!):

mount /dev/sda1 /mnt
mount /dev/sda7 /mnt/home
chroot /mnt
cd /opt/magicq/
./tigstartuprun

This will then ask you to hit any key to enter the software update utility, and you can just press the enter key when this prompt comes up. This will allow you to manually reinstall reselect the software version. You have about a second gap in which to do this before it will time out.

Once the software has been reinstalled, press control + d, and then type "init 6" and hit enter. This should then restart the console into MagicQ.


=== Disc Repair

MagicQ consoles periodically carry out a disk check to check the integrity of the disc.  Normally it will repair errors, but if it unable to repair errors then it may halt and request the root password.  It will stop in the boot sequence with the black screen with white text and will say "run fsck manually" followed by a request to enter the root password.

MagicQ Expert and Pro consoles have 2 partitions - /dev/hda1 and /dev/hda3 - the problem may be with one or both of these partitions.  MagicQ Pro 2010 and Pro 2014 consoles only have one partition /dev/hda1.  Note which partition is requested to check before entering the root password.

Contact support for the root password.  After entering the password you will see the command prompt - this is the username of the console followed by :~#, e.g.

chamsys176:~#

The command prompt allows commands to be entered manually by typing the operating system command followed by the enter key.  Enter one of the two commands below depending on which partition has errors

fsck /dev/hda1
 
or

fsck /dev/hda3

The above commands start a disc check on the relevant partition.  This may take a few minutes. When errors are found you will be prompted whether to to fix items.  Enter "y" to all questions.

On completion, then enter

reboot

and the console will shut down and restart.  

If for any reason the console does not restart, then hold the white reset button on the rear for 15 seconds until the console powers off completely.

On Expert and Pro consoles it may be necessary to follow the above procedure on both /dev/hda1 and /dev/hda3.

Contact your dealer to supply you with the password for your console and to guide you through fixing the disk.  

First check whichAfter entering the password, you will need to check which partition was causing the problem (either /dev/hda1 or /dev/hda3) and enter the command:

fsck /dev/hda1

or

fsck /dev/hda3

When prompted to fix items enter "y".

On completion enter "halt" and the console will shut down.  Press and hold the white reset button on the rear, and the console should restart normally.  It may be necessary to follow the above procedure on both /dev/hda1 and /dev/hda3.


==== Console Command Entry

Occasionally ChamSys support may request you to use the console command entry to fix a problem.  The procedure is different on Pro 2010 consoles from Pro/Expert consoles.  Start by connecting a keyboard to the console.

On Pro/Expert consoles hold the CTRL key on start-up.  You should be presented with a red box on a black screen with the title "LILO".  On the keyboard type the text  linux 2 followed by the ENTER key.  Linux should start to run and after about 5 seconds it should ask you to enter a username and password.  The username is root.  ChamSys support will give you the password.

On Pro 2010 consoles hold the ESC key on start-up.  You should be presented with a list of options, where the top option is "MagicQ Recovery".  Select this option using the up/down cursor keys, and ENTER.   It will ask you for a password after a few seconds; type misspacman, and hit ENTER.   It will then try loading Linux and will ask you to enter a root password for maintenance.  ChamSyss support will give you the password. 


=== Resetting a MagicQ console to factory defaults

The console software upgrade utility has two other functions - reset to
factory defaults and erase console.

"Reset to factory defaults" changes settings back to factory settings
but does not erase any user data. It is recommended that the current
show is saved to a known file name before carrying out a factory reset.
As a consequence of the reset to factory defaults, the console will
reload the default show.

"Erase console" erases all user data and reloads the newest software on
the system. All show data, custom personalities, and settings will be
erased. Ensure all user data is saved before carrying out this action.


=== Upgrading MQ40/60/70 firmware

To upgrade the MQ40/60/70 firmware you must first install version 1.5.9.9 MagicQ software on the console.  Failure to update to this version before performing the firmware upgrade could result in the console needing to be returned to ChamSys for repair. From software 1.5.8.6 the MQ40/60/70 firmware is included in the firmware folder under the name CH331_xxx.hex

To check the version of firmware in use go to Setup, View System, View USB and USB ports.  The software version is shown as the 7th number in the list of parameters.  The complete list of parameters is:

<link drops> <time link has been up> <tx packets> <rx packets> <tx errors> <tx retries> <sw version> <hw version> <build number>


|====
|CH331 Version 0|Original firmware
|CH331_Version 1.0|Added audio support
|CH331_Version 1.1|Added MIDI and LTC timecode support (MQ70 only - not for MQ40/60)
|====


Disconnect any Wings and network devices and remove any USB drives from the console. 
 
Press Setup, View System, View Status and change to the USB Links tab.  If more than one USB device is shown then disconnect all other MagicQ Wings and interfaces.

image:images/mq60upgrade.png[image]

Put the cursor on the line for USB 1 as above.  Press CHANGE FIRMWARE and select the new firmware file - e.g. CH331_V1.0.hex.

MagicQ should then say "Starting firmware upgrade" and then a few seconds later "Sent start upgrade".

image:images/mq60upgrade2.png[image]

Do not touch anything or power off whilst the update is in progress – interrupting the upgrade will leave the Console in an unusable state and it will have to be returned to ChamSys for repair.

MagicQ will then wait between 5 and 10 seconds and then display messages "Sent firmware 1000", "Sent firmware 2000" and so on up to about "Sent firmware 76000".

image:images/mq60upgrade3.png[image]

It will then briefly say "Sent all firmware" and "Programmed Ok".

image:images/mq60upgrade4.png[image]

If all is ok then it will say "Programmed OK" and you are ok to power off the Console and restart it.

If it gets stuck on “Fails to Load Firmware” and the console continues to loop in the Load firmware screen the console should be powered off and will need to be returned to ChamSys UK for re-programming.
