can be used equally well for pre-programmed shows / tours or for busking
festivals. All parameters can be changed during run at the touch of a button.

Ease of use and speed of programming have been at the forefront of the
design process ensuring patching and programing a show in the minimum amount of time without complex button sequences
and multi level menus.

=== MagicQ software and consoles

MagicQ software runs on PCs, Macs and MagicQ consoles and has the same features and user interface on all systems.

MagicQ software enables shows to be pre-programmed on a PC
(Windows, Mac or Linux) enabling Lighting Designers to design and
program their shows in advance. Shows can be transferred between PC, Mac and MagicQ consoles using USB memory sticks, or via direct network connection.

MagicQ PC / Mac supports the same functionality and user interface as the
physical consoles making it easy to move between the two products.
MagicQ PC / Mac can also be used to run complete shows, either as a back-up to
the main console or as console in its own right.

MagicQ consoles are available in several different models all using
the powerful MagicQ software on a Linux operating system giving a reliable operating environment for
programming and playback of shows. A show can be programmed on one
model and then played back on a different model.

MagicQ supports 202 playbacks in total – which
can be be accessed through physical playbacks or through the
touch screen. The different models in the MagicQ console series have different numbers
of physical playbacks and buttons, enabling the size of console to
be matched to the show.

Connecting MagicQ usb Wings to MagicQ PC / Mac gives the playback and
programming control of the MagicQ consoles (faders, encoders and
buttons) but with a small low cost lightweight solution.

DMX512 serial outputs are available from MagicQ software on PC/Mac using the MagicDMX interface, directly from all MagicQ consoles and from the Mini Wing, PC Wing and Maxi Wing.

MagicQ supports Art-Net I, Art-Net II, Art-Net III, Pathport and ACN streaming DMX network outputs from PC, Mac or MagicQ consoles.  MagicQ consoles have multiple network ports for connecting to Art-Net, Pathport and ACN installations.
