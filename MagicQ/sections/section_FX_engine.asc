=== Adding in FX

To apply a FX to some heads, select the heads then from the FX Window,
Group Window, or Prog Window press the ADD FX soft button.

MagicQ groups FX into the categories - Intensity, Position, Colour,
Beam, Any Attribute, User and Old. MagicQ lists all of the stored
“Waveform FX”. Choose the Category and then the FX to apply.

The position category includes FX usingthe pan and tilt attributes:

image:images/fxpos.png[image]

The colour category includes FX using the CMY/RGB attributes:

image:images/fxcol.png[image]

The Any Attribute folder contains FX that are not specific to particular
attributes of the head – these are marked with a * – e.g. Ramp, Sine and
Cosine. When one of these is selected you are prompted for which
attribute you wish to apply the FX to. For instance you could program a
circle using a Sine on the Pan attribute and a Cosine on the Tilt
attribute. Alternatively you could just use the circle FX!

image:images/fxanyattrib.png[image]

You can apply multiple FX to a head, provided that the FX uses different
attributes - e.g. you can mix a Pan Sine with a Tilt Sine.

Once you have chosen a FX you are returned to the Prog Window. Use the
encoders to modify the parameters of the FX such as the speed, size and
spread between heads. By default FX size goes up to 255. Hold SHIFTuse the encoder to get sizes above 255.

The Prog Window provides a Simple and an Advanced View. The Simple View
enables modifications of the FX as applied to all heads. The Advanced
View enables the parameters of the FX to be modified for each different
head – this, for example, enables different sizes to be set for
different heads.

image:images/progfxcircle.png[image]

FX can be added and removed from the Programmer window.


==== FX Speed & Size

The FX Speed can be modified on encoder X. The soft button stops/starts
the FX allowing it to be temporarily stopped.

The FX Crossfade can be set on encoder Y – 0% is snap whilst 100% is
complete crossfade. The soft button can be used to tap to time the speed
of the FX.

The FX Size can be modified on the encoder wheel D from 0% to 100%.
Pressing SHIFT and turning the encoder wheel allows the size to be
oversized up to 800%. Pressing the soft button swaps between the chosen
size and zero size. This allows an FX to be temporarily taken out.


==== FX base values

By default FX are added to the current channel values - therefore it is
important to ensure that the channel values are set correctly. For
example, to run a circle in the centre of a MAC500s pan and tilt range,
it is necessary to set both pan and tilt to the centre position (128)
before adding the FX. Changing the channel values changes the point
around which the FX is centred.

Similarly in order to run a 0% to 100% dimmer chase on HTP channels the
channels should be set to 50% intensity and the FX added.

Channel values and FX values do not have to be recorded onto the same
playback. One playback can be used to set the centre position of the FX
and another to control the FX itself. The centre position can itself be
part of a multi Cue Cue-Stack or a chase thus a particular FX can itself
be moved around.

If you wish to have a particular playback move heads to a particular
position without a FX then record both the position and a zero size FX
on the playback. Recording a zero FX ensures any other playback running
an FX for those heads is over-ridden.


==== FX add modes

It is possible to change the way that FX are added to the base values.
In the FX View of the Prog Window and Cue Window there is an “add mode”
field. Page right to see this option. This determines how the FX in a
Cue is added to the base values. There are three choices; Normal, Plus
and Minus.

* Normal is as default – i.e. a FX will apply both plus and minus of the
base.
* Plus adds the FX onto the top of the current base – i.e. the level
will never be less than the base.
* Minus subtracts the FX from the current base – i.e. the level will
never be greater than the base.
* Abs (absolute). MagicQ ignores the base value for the FX and simply
outputs the FX value. This is useful for absolute position FX and for
colour change FX.



==== FX Spread (offsets over heads)

When a FX is applied to a group of heads, the spread determines how the
FX is played back over all the heads. By default the spread is even
(100%) – i.e. the same FX is applied to each head but offset so that
each of the heads is at a different point in the FX cycle. With even
spread the heads are spread evenly round the cycle.

Setting the Spread to None (0) causes all of the heads to start at the
same point in the cycle – i.e. they all do exactly the same thing.
Choosing values between 0% and 100% enables different looks to be
generated.

The FX Spread is the maximum offset between heads within the FX. FX
Spread values greater than 100% are allowed.

The offsetting of the FX over heads can be further enhanced using FX
Parts and FX Segments. FX parts and FX Segments have no effect if FX
Spread is 0.

The spread can be viewed in the Outputs Window, View Chans, View DMX,
View Move window. This shows a 2D representation of the pan and tilt
values of each of the heads.

image:images/outputsmove.png[image]

==== FX Parts

This enables the FX cycle to be repeated across a number of heads. When
FX parts is 0 the FX is offset across the total umber of heads selected
in the FX. Using Parts the FX can be offset so that, for example the FX
can be offset (with FX parts = 3) such that the FX is offset other the
first 3 heads, and then the next 3 heads, the next 3 heads, and so on…

The FX part can have the values “none”, “2s”, “3s” etc. For example when
set to “3s” the FX will be played back spread over the first 3 heads and
then this will repeat over the remaining selected heads – i.e. heads
1,4,7,10 will do the same thing, heads 2,5,8,11 will do the same thing.
When a “FX part” is selected, the “spread” determines how the FX is
spread across the 3 heads.

==== FX Segments

FX segments work together with FX Parts to enable easy control of the
relative offsets of different heads within a FX. FX Segments are the
number of adjacent heads that have the same offset.

So for example consider 12 heads.

==== FX Direction & Inversion

The FX direction can be set to the following options:

* Forward
* Backward
* Odd/Even
* Even/Odd
* Left/Right
* Right/Left
* Segments
* Invert
* Invert Odd/Even
* Invert Even/Odd
* Invert Left/Right
* Invert Right/Left
* Invert Segments

Forward and Backward affect the direction of the FX. Odd/Even
automatically makes the odd heads go forward and the even heads go
backwards. Left/Right splits the heads in two, with the first half going
forward and the second half going backwards. Segments alternates forward
/ backward for each segment.

Inverts change the polarity of the FX waveform rather than reversing the
direction. For simple FX Waveforms of 1 or 2 steps the resulting FX will
be identical. For FX waveforms with more than 2 steps, they will be
different.

Consider a pulse 2 steps on 4 heads, spread 0%

For FX waveforms that have more than one attribute, the invert is
applied only to first attribute of the FX waveform. This ensures a
simple mirror of movement FX such as circles etc...


==== Pulse Width

The pulse, ramp, dimmer chase and iris chase have Pulse Width on Encoder
C. This enables the width of the FX to be altered without having to
select different FX (e.g. pulse 2 step, pulse 3 step etc...)

When set to 50% it is equivalent to a pulse 2 step. When set to close to
0% the pulse or ramp is very narrow, whilst at close to 100% the pulse
or ramp is very wide.

==== FX fade times

FX can be configured to fade in and out rather than snapping in and out.
The fade times are configured in the View Times view of the Programmer
Window and the Cue Window. In older versions of software they were
available in the View FX view of these windows (use the PAGE RIGHT
button to move to the appropriate columns).


==== Initial spreads

If you are running multiple FX from within a Cue then you may wish to
select an initial spread between the different FX. Configure this from
the Programmer Window and the Cue Window (use the PAGE RIGHT button to
move to the appropriate columns). Both a coarse and a fine spread can be
configured.


==== FX on CMY and RGB fixtures

The inbuilt colour FX are now designed to work on both CMY and RGB
fixtures - these FX are set with the "Auto Invert RGB" option set in the
Waveform FX. This means that, for example, adding the RGB FX to a group
of CMY and RGB fixtures will cause all fixtures to change colour red,
green, blue.


==== Flicker FX

MagicQ includes a number of FX designed to simulate flickers – these can
be used to simulate fires, candles and lightning. FX speed, size and
spread can be used to generate different effects. The flicker FX
available are:

Flicker Random flicker above and below base level

Flicker up Random flicker above the base level

Flicker down Random flicker below the base level

Flicker sync Random flicker – all heads in the FX synchronised together

Flicker crossfade Random flicker with random levels and random
crossfades


==== Multiple FX

It is possible to have multiple different FX on a head – e.g. a circle
on pan and tilt and a red green blue colour mix on the colour mix
attributes.

image:images/progfxcirclergb.png[image]

When viewing and editing multiple FX in the Programmer Window or Cue
Window the encoders A,B,C,D,X and Y affect only the FX that the cursor
is placed over. Prior to v1.3.2.4 they always affected all FX in the
Programmer/Cue. When a new FX is added the encoders automatically
default to controlling the parameters of the new FX.

If the cursor is placed in the All FX row at the top of the Window then
these encoders affect all FX as per previous behaviour. The E encoder
can still be used to modify the individual parameter at the cursor
location.


==== Joining / Spliting multiple FX

There is a function to split some heads out of a FX or to join similar
FX together in the Programmer – use SHIFT and the JOIN FX and SPLIT FX
soft buttons.

When Split FX is pressed the currently selected heads are moved out of
the FX that they are in, into a separate FX. If the selected heads are
the only heads in the FX then no change is made to the FX.

When Join FX is pressed MagicQ analyses all the FX in the programmer and
joins any similar FX of the same type together. The speeds/sizes/offsets
are retained until the enlarged FX are modified.


==== Modifying FX for selected Heads

It is possible to change FX for a specific set of heads by first
selecting the heads and then modifying the parameters in the FX Window
instead of in the Programmer Window. In the FX Window there are FX
speed, size, crossfade and offset encoders. These encoders apply changes
to the FX of the currently selected heads. Note they affect all FX
running on those heads so if the head has a circle and a CMY colour FX
then both will be changed. To change FX individually use the encoders in
the Programmer Window, FX View.


==== Changing FX

It is possible to change the type of FX running on a selection of heads
from within the Programmer Window using the CHANGE FX soft button. This
enables a different FX to be selected, but with the speed, size and
offsets remaining the same. The FX can only be changed into compatible
FX – i.e. a circle can be changed into a square or diamond, but not into
a RGB effect.


==== FX Reordering

It is possible to reorder the heads in a FX without having to recreate
the FX. Press the REORDER FX button in the Programmer, View FX View.
MagicQ prompts for the order, Normal, Reverse, Into Centre, Centre Out,
Random. Normal will always return them to head number order.

Note that if the current selection order is different to the one in the
Cue then it will automatically use this as the new order rather than
prompting for an order.


==== Blocking FX

When the Setup option “Programmer overrides FX” is set then the
Programmer automatically includes a “Block FX” option – this means that
whenever a channel is in the programmer it has an implicit zero FX – so
that any FX running on the channel on Playbacks is ignored. If the
channel has a FX in the programmer then the FX will run as expected.
This, for example, enables the user to take control of a moving light
and place it in a fixed position.


==== One Shot FX

MagicQ has support for one shot FX – i.e. FX that play back only one
cycle and then stop. There are two example one shot FX in the FX library
- PulseOne and RampOne. Custom waveform FX can be created and set as one
shot in the FX parameters.


=== Generating user FX

It is possible to generate user FX by programming a chase and then
converting it into a FX. The FX can then be applied to any head with the
required attributes.

For example, to create a new movement FX, create a position chase by
recording the pan and tilt values for one or more heads. Set the chase
speed to the speed that you wish the FX to default to. If you wish the
FX to snap (not fade) then set the chase contrast to 0%.

Convert the chase into a FX by opening the Cue Stack window and pressing
SHIFT and MAKE FX. If the chase only contains 1 attribute then you will
be asked whether you wish the FX to always apply to the specified
attribute, or to allow it to be applied to any attribute. If the Cue
Stack has more than 1 attribute in it, then the user is prompted to
choose which attributes to use in the Waveform FX.

If multiple heads are used in the chase then multiple heads will be
generated in the FX – this enables different heads in the FX to do
completely different FX. (For example, you could record a FX where 2
heads do a tilt and 2 heads do a pan)

To record a FX that can be applied to any attribute, choose 1 attribute
only (e.g. dimmer) and create the chase using this attribute. When you
press MAKE FX, then select the “Make FX apply to any attribute” option.

Waveform FX support any number of attributes but it is recommended that
only a small number of attributes are stored in Waveform FX – e.g. just
position, colour mix or intensity. For more complex FX store the FX in
the FX Window and save to a FX Library.

Use Record Remove to remove unwanted
attributes from entire Cue Stack.


=== Editing user FX

MagicQ includes a <<_fx_editor,FX Editor>> which can be used to edit
the Waveform FX. Note that changing the Waveform FX makes a permanent
change to the FX on the MagicQ system including all FX of that type used
in the current show and on any new shows made on that console. If users
wish to edit the inbuilt Waveform FX then they should use “Save As” to
save the FX as a different FX name before editing.

All User FX are shown in the User category - only inbuilt FX are shown
in the Intensity, Position, Colour and Beam categories.

All FX are stored in the FX folder as .wve files - MagicQ intelligently
filters them into categories.


=== Palette FX

Some of the inbuilt FX use Palette values rather than absolute values.
This enables FX to be built up quickly from existing Palettes. The FX
are updated each time the Palette is changed.

Palettes can be chosen when the FX is applied rather than having to
create new Waveform FX. Palette selection can be changed directly in the
Programmer, View FX and Cue , View FX windows. Changes of Palette
selection are immediately updated in the Output.

The inbuilt library of FX contains several Waveform FX that allow
selection of Palettes - including 2col, 3col, 4col, 2pos, 3pos, 4pos,
2iris and 2focus.

For example, to make a FX that colour changes between yellow and magenta
simply choose the 2col FX - then select the "Yellow" palette, followed
by the "Magenta" palette. Change the width parameter to vary the
proportion of time spent on yellow and magenta.

Users can create their own waveform FX using the FX Editor. To make a
waveform FX that has selected palettes, set both the "Use Palettes" and
"Use FX Palettes" in the Edit FX, View General. The palettes in Edit FX,
View Chans are then Palette indices rather than Palette numbers - e.g.
Col 1 refers to the first selected Palette when you apply the FX, Col 2
the second selected Palette.


=== FX colour flicks

MagicQ supports colour flicks - i.e. FX that apply a different colour
over the base colour without mixing the colours - for example running a
red flick over a green base without mixing the red and green to get
yellow.

The inbuilt FX library now includes Red, Green, Blue and White colour
flicks. In addition there is a colflick FX where you select the colour
you want from a colour palette. The width parameter can be modified to
change the width of the flick.

Users can create their own Waveform FX to perform complex colour flicks.
In Edit FX, View General set the Default Add Type to "Abs". In the Edit
FX, View Chans set the curve to "Abs" for steps that you want to be
absolute and to "Trans" for steps that you want to be transparent (i.e.
not affected by the FX - just the base level). The levels for steps set
to "Trans" should be 0, or if using Palette based FX then just set them
to the first Palette selection (P1,C1,B1).


=== FX using base colour

It is possible to create FX that use any chosen colour rather than just
primary colours – a new example Colpulse.wve is included as part of the
standard FX library.

When the FX is created, the base level of the colour channel will be
used to determine the colour that the FX will use. When the FX is played
back the base level is used in the FX itself rather than the FX adding
to the base.

To create a new FX based on base colour, in the FX Edit Window, View
General, set Use Col Base = Yes.


=== FX Window

FX can be recorded for re-use in multiple Cues when programming, or when
busking live to quickly apply a complete FX over multiple heads.

The FX Window enables the storage of FX and combinations of FX that are
used regularly. The FX Window is opened by pressing the FX button
(formerly the ATTR button.)

image:images/fxeditsoft.png[image]

Record FX into the FX Window in the normal way – set up the FX in the
programmer and then press RECORD. All of the different FX currently in
the programmer are stored including all of the size, speed and offset
information. In addition, any base levels for the channels that are
controlled by the FX are also stored.

To recall the FX simply select some heads, and then select the FX from
the FX Window. FX can be named, moved and copied just like any windows
items. FX can be played back on any head that supports the programmed
attributes – not just the heads the FX was recorded with.

To edit FX you can include an FX into the programmer and then use
Update.

Note that FX are actually stored as Cues – you can see them in the Cue
Store – however there is no need to access them other than through the
FX window.

When you program new Cues using a FX selected from the FX window, a copy
of the FX is made so that you can make individual changes in the
programmed Cue. Editing the FX in the FX window will not affect your
programmed Cues – only new Cues programmed using the FX.


=== Importing and Exporting the FX Library

The FX in the FX Window can be stored to a FX library file so that the
FX can be reloaded and reused in any MagicQ show. Use the SAVE FX LIB to
make a FX library file – all the FX in the FX window are stored to the
file. The FX are saved as generic FX – i.e. they can be played back on
any type of head as long as it has the same attributes. Reload a FX
library using the LOAD FX LIB.
