image:images/mq100angle.jpg[image]

MagicQ Pro series is built on the MagicQ MQ100 console and the MagicQ Playback Wing and MagicQ Execute Wing.  The MagicQ MQ200 is a MQ100 with a Playback Wing physically connected whilst the MQ300 has two Playback Wings connected.  The MQ200 Execute and MQ300 Execute have a Playback Wing replaced with an Execute Wing.

The MagicQ Playback Wing provides 24 additional fader playbacks split into two banks of 12.

The MagicQ Execute Wing provides 48 additional playbacks - one bank of 12 fader playbacks and three banks of 12 button playbacks.

The MagicQ MQ100 Pro-E is an entry level version of the MQ100 Pro console with reduced universes and connectivity.

The picture below shows the connections on a MQ100 Pro 2010 console. The
MQ200 Pro 2010 and MQ300 Pro 2010 have the same connectors with the
addition of extra console lamp sockets.

Pro 2014 consoles are the same except that they have a MIDI/SMPTE
interface fitted in one of the expansion modules.

MagicQ MQ100 Pro-E (originally Expert) consoles have a similar rear panel but with only one
network port and two (non locking) USB ports. MQ100 Pro-E consoles do not have VGA ports for additional monitors.

=== MagicQ Wings for use with PC/Mac

The MagicQ Mini Wing, MagicQ PC Wing and MagicQ Maxi Wing connect directly to a PC or Mac.  The PC or Mac runs the MagicQ software and processes the Cues whilst the wing acts as a physical surface with faders, buttons and encoders and outputs DMX.




=== Plugging Up

All MagicQ consoles and SnakeSys interfaces have auto ranging power supplies and can accept 110V to 240V AC on the blue powercon socket.

* Connect the power lead to the power socket labelled LINE INPUT.
* Put the console lamp(s) into the console lamp socket(s)

* Connect the keyboard to the socket on the back panel marked KEYBOARD

MagicQ Pro 2010, Pro 2014 and Compact consoles support USB keyboards and mice.
It is not necessary to connect the mouse. The mouse is only required if
the touch screen becomes damaged.


=== DMX Connections

The MagicQ Pro, Pro 2010 and Pro 2014 series of consoles have 4 direct
DMX outputs on the rear of the panel so you can connect your DMX cables
direct to the console.

Alternatively you can connect to an Ethernet network using the Art-Net, Pathport or ACN Streaming DMX protocols and use external Ethernet to DMX
converters to output the DMX.  

The network ports on the Pro 2010, Pro 2014 and Compact series all have auto MDI/MDIX detection so a normal or inverted network cable can be used to connect to other network devices.  Most modern laptops and computers also have auto MDI/MDIX detection.

ChamSys offer a range of Ethernet to DMX convertors including the
SnakeSys T2, B4, R4 and R8 Ethernet to DMX interfaces.  These can be used
to convert any of the 64 Art-Net or ACN Streaming DMX universes to be output on DMX512
serial. For systems requiring all 64 universes on DMX512,
multiple interfaces may be used connected via network switches.



=== Powering Up

To power up the console press the power switch on the rear panel. The
blue LEDs on the ten S buttons will light up in turn. After a few
seconds the screen will come to life and you will see the operating
system quickly performing self tests. Once the self tests are completed
the MagicQ application is started.


=== Powering Down

To power down the console it is necessary to quit the MagicQ
application. The console operating system then performs an automatic
shutdown and turns itself off when complete. To quit the MagicQ
application, press the SETUP button and then the QUIT soft button. When
asked for confirmation, press the YES.

Note that just removing the power cord to the console will not have the
desired effect since the internal UPS continues to provide power.

If for some reason you are unable to power off the console then you may
need to reset it as below.


=== Resetting the Console

Under rare circumstance it may be necessary to reset the console.

To reset the console, press SETUP to go to the Setup Window and press
SHIFT and QUIT. This performs an immediate soft reset of the console -
the MagicQ application will be running the show again within about 2-3
seconds.

If for some reason the console does not respond to button presses then
try pressing CTRL BREAK on the external keyboard (hold CTRL whilst
pressing BREAK).

If this has no effect then a hard reset may be required. Hard resets
should be avoided as they bypass the operating system shutdown
procedures and may cause problems with the file system. To perform a
hard reset, press and hold the reset button on the back panel for 5
seconds.

To force the console to power off completely, press and hold the reset
button on the back panel until it powers off (approximately 10 seconds.)

=== Power Supply Protection

MagicQ MQ60, MQ70, MQ100, MQ200 and MQ300 have an internal battery
designed to protect the system against short term power losses on
troublesome power supplies. The internal battery is not designed to
support the running of the console for long periods of time. If the
power is lost then the console will prompt the user to fix the problem
or to shut down the console. The battery when fully charged will support
the console for between 5 and 15 minutes.

If your version of the console does not have an internal battery then we
recommend the use of a UPS (Un-interruptible Power Supply).


=== Care of your MagicQ console

* To keep your MagicQ console in best condition please observe the following
recommendations:

* Keep liquids away from the MagicQ. Drinks split over your console may
cause irreparable damage.

* Keep the console out of direct sunlight – place the console in the
shade.

* Do not use the console outside its operating temperature range.

* Handle the console with care when moving or transporting it. The
console contains components that may be damaged by shock. Always use a
padded flight case or padded bag wherever possible.

* Do not use solvents or cleansers to clean the console. Do not rub
firmly on the metal or plastic surfaces – this may cause the paint or
lettering to be removed. Gently use a damp cloth to clean the panels.

=== Safety Information

* Do not open the front, rear or lower panels of the console unless you
have electrical expertise. The console contains components with voltages
that may shock.

* Do not use the console if the power cables are damaged in any way.

* Repairs should only be undertaken by authorised service
representatives.

* If liquids are spilt over the console then remove power immediately,
and seek advice from your authorised service representative.
