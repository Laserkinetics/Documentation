== MagicQ Visualiser

=== MagicVis

MagicQ includes a visualiser called MagicVis available for Windows, Mac
and Linux.

image:images/MagicVis.png[image]

MagicVis is available in two versions:

* A standalone application called MagicVis that can connect to a MagicQ
console or receive ArtNet or ACN data from other brands of console
over a network.

* Part of the MagicQ PC application.  This allows the editing and
  visualisation of a show on one PC.

The MagicVis application enables Lighting Designers to add visualisation
to their MagicQ console simply by connecting a network cable and
starting the MagicVis application. The graphics and processor intensive
visualisation is performed on the attached computer, thus ensuring that
the MagicQ console continues to run at full performance.

In order to render the beams MagicVis uses the graphics card in your PC
/ Mac - the better the performance of your graphics card then the better
performance of the visualiser.  PCs and Macs with shared graphics memory
will perform slowly and will only be able to render small lighting rigs.
A Nvidia or ATI/Radeon graphics card costing £100/£120€/160$ will make
all the difference to your system.

==== Using the Separate MagicVis Application

The separate MagicVis application can connect to a console or a separate
PC running MagicQ software. The show will be automatically loaded from
the console over the network.

Configure the IP addresses of the both the console and the laptop to be
within the same IP address range, e.g. set the console to IP address
2.0.0.1 netmask 255.0.0.0 and the laptop to 2.0.0.2 netmask 255.0.0.0.
On the console

[white black-background]#setup# -> VIEW SETTINGS -> Multi Console

and ensure that *Enable Remote Control* and *Enable Remote Access* are
set to *yes*.

Connect the console and the PC/Mac with an inverted network cable. 
Start MagicVis and click on 'File' -> 'Settings...' to bring up the
'Settings' dialog.  Click on the 'Network' tab then choose the network
adaptor/IP address of the network port that connects to the MagicQ
console. Then select the console from the list. If there is only one
console on the network then MagicVis should automatically connect to
it. If the name of the console appears in red then make sure that
*Enable Remote Control* and *Enable Remote Access* are set to *yes* on
the console. If the IP address is red then it is on the wrong subnet.

image:images/magicvisdesign.png[image]

Initially the title bar in MagicVis will show *searching for
consoles*, then *waiting for connection* once it has found a console.
Once a connection has been made with the console then it will change
to say *waiting sync*. Once the show data has been transferred over
the connection from the console to the MagicQ vis application then it
will change to say *synced*.

If the system continues to say *waiting for connection* then check IP
address are correct and check firewalls are disabled. In some systems
you may need to disable other network adaptors such as the wireless
adaptor.

Once MagicVis is synced then whenever you load a new show on the
console or change the visualiser patch then the changes will
automatically appear in the visualiser.

When MagicVis starts it assumes that it will receive DMX data on ArtNet
starting from ArtNet Universe 0-0. As soon as MagicVis has a connection
with a console it then starts using the DMX protocols and universes in
use on that console for each of the patched universes. If the universes
are not enabled on the console then the console will send the DMX data
directly to the MagicVis using its own MagicVis protocol. This enables
MagicVis to be used on a system where the outputs are not enabled.

Note that even when MagicVis is not synced it will visualise according
to received ArtNet. ArtNet is sent separately to the connection for show
data transfer.

==== Using MagicVis with other consoles

MagicVis can be used with third-party consoles other than MagicQ.  The
visualisation show must first be created in MagicQ and then loaded
into MagicVis for use with the other console.

Load a MagicQ show file directly into MagicVis by clicking on 'File'
-> 'Load Show'. In this mode there is no sync, MagicVis just looks at
the incoming ArtNet data for rendering the beams but does not sync the
patch.

TIP: Once a show has been loaded using 'Load Show' MagicVis will not
try to sync with a console.

==== Using the Visualiser in MagicQ

Run the MagicQ software then go to the 'Visualiser' menu in the menu bar and
click on 'Show Visualiser'. The window can be sized and moved to the
required position.

image:images/magicqandvis.png[image]

As the Visualiser is integrated with the MagicQ app it is not necessary
to set up IP addresses or enable/configure universes.

=== Using MagicVis

MagicVis provides five views – Perspective, Top, Side, Front, and Free. 
The view can be changed either from the 'View' menu in the MagicVis
window or in MagicQ in the 'Patch' window, using Soft Button E.  The
Top, Side, Front and Free views are orthographic projections.  If the
camera is moved while in an orthographic view then the view
automatically becomes Free.

You can rotate the camera around by pointing the mouse at the visualiser
window, clicking and holding then moving the mouse around. Move the
camera back and forth with the scroll wheel, or by pressing CTRL and
right-clicking. Hold down SHIFT, click and move the mouse to translate
the camera and hold SHIFT and move the scroll wheel to zoom in and out.

The lighting level of the room can be changed by clicking on 'View' ->
'Dark'.

TIP: The demo show files have visualiser rooms set up.  The
'ExhibitionDemo' file uses MagicVis extensively and includes MagicHD
integration.  Use these to see examples of how to create your own
MagicVis visualisations.


==== Patching Fixtures in the Visualiser

When you patch the first head in your show, MagicQ will prompt you
whether you wish to auto insert heads into the visualiser.

image:images/autopatchinvis.png[image]

Once a head has been patched into your show MagicQ will not prompt you
again. If you wish to change the setting then you can enable or disable
auto insertion in

[white black-background]#setup# -> VIEW SETTINGS -> Mode -> Visualiser.

When you patch heads in VIEW HEADS, MagicQ patches the head in the VIEW
HEADS view but also generates a visualiser object in VIEW VIS.

Visualiser heads are separate from MagicQ heads – for instance you can
have multiple visualiser heads associated with one patched head. You
might want to do this if you had two par cans on a single dimmer channel
– you would have one Generic Dimmer patched in MagicQ and two visualiser
heads.

By default when you patch heads MagicQ creates one visualiser head per
MagicQ head. You can add extra visualiser objects for a head using
INSERT.

==== View Vis View

[white black-background]#Patch# -> VIEW VIS

The VIEW VIS view manages the data for the visualiser. There are several
different tabs including Selected Heads, Vis Heads, and Attach Objects.

image:images/patchvisheads.png[image]

In 'Selected Heads', all the visualiser heads for the currently selected
heads will be shown in the list. Heads are selected as usual using
groups or direct from the keypad. In this view the encoders and soft
buttons will apply changes to all the visualiser heads for the selected
heads.

In Vis Heads, all the visualiser heads are shown.  In this view the
encoders and soft buttons will apply changes to the visualiser head
under the cursor. Use SHIFT/CTRL and the cursor keys to apply changes to
multiple heads.

In Attach Objects, all the other (non fixture) objects are shown in a
list. In this view the encoders and soft buttons will apply changes to
the object under the cursor. Use SHIFT/CTRL and the cursor keys to apply
changes to multiple objects.


==== Positioning the Heads in the Visualisation

When you patch heads they automatically become selected so that in

[white black-background]#Patch# -> VIEW VIS -> Selected Heads

you will have direct control of the positioning and orientation of the
head using the encoder wheels and soft buttons.

Encoders X, Y and F are used for X,Y and Z positioning.

Pressing the soft buttons X, Y and F increases the position by 1 metre
on that axis. Pressing SHIFT + the soft button decreases the position by
1 metre on that axis.

Use fan to spread the position apart on the X,Y, or Z position wheels.

Encoders B, C and D are used for rotation around the X, Y and Z axis.

Pressing the soft buttons B, C and D rotates the heads by 90 degrees
around that axis. Pressing SHIFT + the soft button rotates the heads by
– 90 degrees around that axis.

You can also enter values directly into the spreadsheet view of the VIEW
VIS window.

You can change multiple values at a time by using SHIFT/CTRL and the
cursor keys.  Use THRU to enter a spread of values e.g. -5 THRU 5 to
spread the X position between -5 and 5 metres.

==== Objects

image:images/patchselectedheads.png[image]

In View Attach you can insert truss, pipe, form or room objects.  The
wall, people and furniture objects are not currently supported.

To create an Object press the INSERT soft button, then select what kind
of object is to be created.  The object is then created and added to the
list.  To add a sphere or a cylinder create a 'Form' object then go to
the 'model' column, press Set and select the desired shape.

Enter values in the window for length, width and height.  Adding a /
after the number enters the dimension in feet rather than metres – so
for 10 feet enter 10/.

Position the truss or pipe as required. Enter a name in the window for
the truss or pipe.

After you insert a truss or pipe, then subsequent heads that are patched
will be attached to that truss or pipe object.  If for example you patch
6 spots after inserting a truss object, then they will be spread out
along the length of the truss.

When you create reports, then as well as overall plots, a plot is
created for each attach object – enabling the lighting rig to be broken
down into separate pipes and trusses.

[TIP]
====
Create a truss and set the model to *Invisible* to group lights together
and create useful plots for them.

For example in the 'ExhibitionDemo' show the PixelLine fixtures may be
rigged on individual vertical pipes but in MagicVis they are all rigged
on one invisible truss which is rotated so that when the paperwork is
created there is a plot with all the PixelLines on it rotated so that it
is obvious how they are laid out.
====

==== Attaching Heads to Objects

Heads can be attached to trusses or pipes at any time. Select the
fixtures you wish to attach using groups or the keypad. Change to VIEW
VIS -> Selected Heads tab and press the FIT TO OBJECT soft button.

Alternatively in the Vis Heads tab, double click on the Attach field.
MagicQ will prompt you with a list of all the attach objects to choose
from.

Heads that are attached to an object move with that object – so
repositioning that object in the Attach Objects tab will move the object
and all the attached heads.

MagicVis supports Hang Types so that Heads can be fitted to Attach Objects in specific orientations.  This information is also available in the MagicVis reports.  Hang type options are Normal, Bottom rear, Bottom front, Top rear, Top front face up, Top front face forwards, Top boom, and Bottom Boom.

==== Modifying Beam Angle and Fixture Shape

In Patch, View Heads it is possible to set specific shapes and beam angles for generic heads.  When set these fields override the defaults from the chosen personality. The shape is also shown in the Fixture Patch report.

If you wish to change the beam angle for fixtures other than generic heads then you must change the Zoom Narrow and Wide in the Params tab of the Head Editor for the chosen personality.
 
==== Visualising Media Servers

MagicVis can preview the output from media servers, including MagicHD.
First of all make sure that the Media window on the console is
displaying a live preview of the media server output. Then, in the
'Attach Objects' window add a 'Form'. Set the 'Model' to 'Sheet' and set
the 'Texture' to 'mp' and the number of the media server. The Media
Server number can be found in the 'Setup', 'View System', 'View Media'
window.

For example if the media server was the first in the 'View Media' window
then the 'Texture' would be 'mp1'. If MagicVis is unable to connect to
the media server then the sheet will display “Media Server 1”. If there
is still no connection after 1 minute then the text will disappear. The
preview is done via CITP so is quite low resolution.

==== Moving Trusses

To make an attach object movable via DMX patch a Generic Movement head
into MagicQ.  Then in Patch, View Vis set the attach object for the
Generic Movement to be the Attach object to move.  Any fixtures hung
from the truss will move along with the truss.

The Generic Movement head has X, Y, Z position and X, Y, Z rotation
attributes enabling complete control of the object from within MagicQ.
The Generic movement head is a virtual head so it can be unpatched in
the MagicQ Patch.

NOTE: In the 'ExhibitionDemo' showfile there are 2 moving pipes.  Each
pipe has a form attached to it on which the MagicHD image is rendered.
This provides a nice simulation of moving LED walls.

==== DMX Controlled Camera

The Generic Camera head enables the Visualiser view to be modified from
within MagicQ programming.  When a Generic Camera is patched in MagicQ
and the Mode Attribute is non zero then the Visualiser view comes under
the control of the Camera.  The Generic Camera head is a virtual head so
it can be unpatched in the MagicQ Patch.

To use the Generic Camera select it then press Locate.  This will put
the camera into perspective mode and place it in the default position.
Select the Position window then use the encoders to move it around and
rotate the view.  To return control to the Visualiser window use Encoder
Wheel A to set the mode to Disabled.

The Generic Camera also controls the brightness of the room and of the
beams.  These attributes can be found in the Beam window.

TIP: FX can be applied to the position and rotation attributes to make
the Camera fly around the visualiser and give a dynamic view of your
design.

==== Removing Visualiser Heads and Objects

To remove a visualiser head go to VIEW VIS -> Vis Heads and put the
cursor on the item. Press REMOVE. Use SHIFT/CTRL and the cursor keys to
cursor select multiple visualiser heads for removal. To remove an attach
object go to VIEW VIS -> Attach Objects and follow the same procedure.

When heads are removed from the visualiser they are not removed from
MagicQ patch.  Removing heads from the MagicQ patch will remove any
associated visualiser heads.


==== Changing the Size of the Room

It is possible to change the size of the room by adding a Room Object.
By default MagicQ uses a room 20 x 20 x 20 metres. If you add a room
object then MagicVis will use the dimensions of the room object instead.
The datum is always on the floor in the centre of the room.

In View Attach, press INSERT. Select the object type *Room* and enter
the length, width, and height.

==== Paperwork

You can use MagicVis to create plots and patch sheets. In the MagicVis
window click on 'File' -> 'Paperwork'. This will bring up the Reports window.

image:images/visreports.png[image]

You can select what you would like to include and either print it out or
create a PDF document. You can also export patch lists into a
spreadsheet such as Numbers, LibreOffice Calc or Excel. To do this click
on one of the 'Export CSV...' buttons, then load the csv file into a
spreadsheet. You can then add extra columns or lay out the tables
however you like.

image:images/magicvisplot.png[image]

The Patch Sheets contain all the heads in the patch, whether or not they
are in the Visualiser. Therefore you can create a patch sheet without
having to load fixtures into Visualiser.

The Positions table is a list of all the trusses and pipes with trim
heights, DMX universes and approximate weights. The given weight is the
total weight of the fixtures and does not include the weight of the
cabling, truss or rigging. It is intended to be a tool for estimating
total weights and should not be used for rigging calculations.


==== Converting an Existing MagicQ Show File

Old MagicQ show files can be loaded into MagicQ, but they will not have
any visualiser heads defined. It is easy to take heads from an existing
show file and create a visualisation.

Select the heads using groups or the keypad. Then go to

[white black-background]#Patch# -> VIEW VIS -> Selected Heads

and press the INSERT SELECTED soft button. This creates a
visualiser head for each of the selected heads.

If you wish, you can attach the heads to an object using the FIT TO
OBJECT soft button.

It is also possible to insert all the patched heads in your show file
into the visualiser in one step. Make sure no heads are selected, then
go to 

[white black-background]#Patch# -> VIEW VIS -> Vis Heads

and press the INSERT PATCHED soft. This creates a visualiser head for
each head in the patch. The heads will be positioned in a grid format.

==== Converting a MagicQ Grid Into a Visualisation

It is possible to convert a grid from the MagicQ Plan View into a
visualisation. In the Output Window, View Plan press SHIFT + ARRANGE
VIS. MagicQ will prompt you for the positioning within the
visualisation.

image:images/vischoosepos.png[image]

For each of the heads in the grid a visualiser head will be will be
inserted into the visualiser. The positioning will be set according to
the position in the grid.

For example if you select Top, then MagicQ will treat the grid as if it
is a top view and all the visualiser heads will be positioned at the top
of the room at the same height.

==== Visualiser Settings

MagicVis includes settings for how the visualisation looks.

image:images/magicvissettings.png[image]

On systems with lower power graphics cards which are using a lot of LED
fixtures we recommend to turn off drawing of LED Beams.


==== Plots

MagicQ now incorporates a Plot Window displaying the position and orientation of fixtures within the lighting rig.  The Plot Window can show Front, Overhead and Side elevations, restricted to either Flown or Floor fixtures and the view can be moved and zoomed.  The view can be restricted to only selected fixtures or to all fixtures.  Fixtures can be selected from the plot window either by clicking (touching) individual items or by multi selecting multiple items.   The positional information is taken from MagicVis and can be edited in the Patch Window.  

The Plot Window is available on MagicQ PC for Windows, Mac and Linux and on the MQ1000.  It is not currently available on Pro or Compact consoles.
