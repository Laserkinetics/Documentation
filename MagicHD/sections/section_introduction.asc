== Introduction

MagicHD is a DMX controlled media player. Media playback is managed in layers. MagicHD can display
up to 8 <<_media_layers,media layers>> (depending on product), one <<_text_layer,text layer>> and a final <<_output_layer,output layer>> for overall
control of the output.

MagicHD runs on Windows, Mac and Linux, and can exist as a stand-alone player, or be launched from
MagicQ PC. It can be installed on dedicated hardware, either supplied by the user, or purchased from
ChamSys<<1>>.

Each <<_media_layers,media layer>> layer can display one <<_media,media file>> (movie, picture or audio) and optionally apply a <<_masks,mask>>. 
Layers are stacked from 1 (the bottom) to 8 (the top). Subject to masking and blending, higher 
layers will hide lower layers. The output layer can also apply a mask, with the intention that this
 is used for shuttering, edge blending and similar projector control effects. You can of course use
 the masks for anything you wish.

The <<_text_layer,text layer>> can display static or moving text. The text is displayed in a window whose colour,
position and orientation can be controlled. Content is supplied as raw text files.

Both the media and output layers can apply a number of <<_colour_effect,colour effects>>. Effects applied in the
output layer affect the appearance of the whole output.

Conceptually, the output seen by the viewer is the top of a stack of layers:

[width="25%",cols="^1h,<2"]
|====
|Top|Colour control
|   |Final mask
|   |Text
|   |Media N
|   |...
|   |Media 3
|   |Media 2
|Bottom|Media 1
|====


MagicHD has no user interface as such, being entirely controlled by DMX. It does provide a <<_head_up_display,Head Up 
Display (HUD)>> which shows a lot of useful information, live, superimposed on the output.

The <<_dmx_personality,DMX control personality>> is deliberately simple: complexity is added by the lighting console. 
Since everything is controlled by DMX channels, the console can be used to add effects to any 
channel by simply altering the values sent to the player.

=== Disclaimer
This product is not fully released so the <<_dmx_personality,DMX personalities>> used to control it may change without 
notice. If such a change occurs then show files using MagicHD will have to be manually updated. 
Changes will be detailed in <<appendix_a,Appendix A>>.

=== Known Problems
Known major problems with MagicHD:

* Playback of multiple layers of some HD media content types can be jerky or slow the system down: 
load management is not yet implemented (whereby lower layers will skip frames to ensure the correct
 frame rate is maintained).
* When the text layer fills the screen rendering can be jerky due to huge font sizes.
* Aspect ratio appears to change when objects are rotated.
* With Windows 8 MagicHD must be run as administrator for media conversion to work.
* Some content encoded with the jpeg2000 codec causes ffmpeg (the tool used to convert media) to
 crash. If this happens the user will have to convert the media offline with a different tool.

=== Changes
Changes to <<_dmx_personality,DMX personalities>> are described in <<appendix_a,Appendix A>>. These are changes that might break shows
 based on older versions.
