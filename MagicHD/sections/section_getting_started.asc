== Getting Started
The following instructions assume you are using MagicHD as part of MagicQ PC (the <<_combined,combined version>>).
Most steps are the same for other system configurations.

=== Super Quick Start
[white black-background]#setup# -> NEW SHOW

[white black-background]#patch# -> CHOOSE DIM/MEDIA -> MagicHD -> PATCH IT

In the patch keypad, type 1 and ENTER, then NO.

[white black-background]#setup# -> VIEW SYSTEM -> VIEW MEDIA

From the <<magicq_menu,MagicQ menu>>: 

Media Player -> View Media Output

Media Player -> Select Server, close.

Select the MagicHD window, position it in the required screen and press *F11* (Mac: *Shift*-*Cmd*-*F*, Linux: *Shift*-*Ctrl*-*F*).

[white black-background]#media# -> Output -> LOCATE -> Layer 1 -> LOCATE

=== Quick Start
[white black-background]#setup# -> NEW SHOW

[white black-background]#patch# -> CHOOSE DIM/MEDIA -> MagicHD -> PATCH IT

In the patch keypad, type 1 and ENTER, then NO.

MagicHD takes one whole <<_universe,DMX universe>> so there are no alternative configurations.

[white black-background]#patch# -> VIEW DMX

to confirm.

[white black-background]#setup# -> VIEW SYSTEM -> VIEW MEDIA 

should show server 1 being a MagicHD with *Local* as the IP address. This means it will be accessed directly, not over the network. 

Edit the name if you wish: double click the name, or select the cell then press [white black-background]#set# twice.

Enable live previews for the server: double click on the *Live prev* cell and select YES, or select the cell and type 1, ENTER.

From the <<magicq_menu,MagicQ menu>>:

Media Player -> View Media Output

to start MagicHD. A blank window should appear. This can be moved around your screen(s) and maximised (without a border) by pressing *F11* (Mac: *Shift*-*Cmd*-*F*, Linux: *Shift*-*Ctrl*-*F*).

Media Player -> Select Server

allows you to choose the ID for the local MagicHD window.


[white black-background]#media#

will show the MagicQ media window. The MagicHD that you just patched should appear as a button, along with buttons to select the <<_media_layers,media>>, <<_text_layer,text>> and <<_output_layer,output>> layers. If you have media, thumbnails should appear below the layer buttons:

image:images/media_window_1.png[media window screenshot]

Output -> LOCATE -> Layer 1 -> LOCATE

will display the media from Media Folder 1/Media File 1 at full intensity.

===  Adding a Mask
[white black-background]#media# -> MagicHD -> Layer 1 -> Mask

then use Mask Folder and Mask File to select a <<_masks,mask>>. Thumbnails should be displayed for each folder: simply select the mask by clicking a thumbnail.

===  HUD
[white black-background]#media# -> MagicHD -> Output -> Media

will allow encoder wheel A to select the <<_head_up_display,HUD>>. 
Alternatively press and hold ``HUD Control'' to bring up soft buttons for each option, or click the top and bottom of ``HUD Control'' to cycle through the options.

===  Keystone
[white black-background]#media# -> MagicHD -> Output -> Frame

===  Projector Colour Control
[white black-background]#media# -> MagicHD -> Output -> Col

Red, Green and Blue encoders control the <<_r_g_b_3,colour balance of the output>>.

===  Displaying Text
[white black-background]#media# -> MagicHD -> Text -> LOCATE

Use Text Folder / Text File to select your text file. At this point you should see your text.

Use Pos to size and position the <<_text_layer,text layer>> (default is full screen)

Use Media -> No Of Lines to control how much text is shown in the window

Use Media -> Scroll Dir to control how the text scrolls if it doesn't fit into the window.

=== MagicHD Window
MagicHD is launched from the MagicQ PC application via the <<magicq_menu,Media Player menu>>. 
It can also be closed from here, or by closing its window.

The MagicHD window can be positioned and sized just like any other application window. 

To go full screen with no borders (i.e. ready for output to a projector):

* select the window and press *F11* (Mac: *Shift*-*Cmd*-*F*, Linux: *Shift*-*Ctrl*-*F*)
* in the MagicQ application: menu -> <<magicq_menu,Media Player>> -> Full Screen, or
* in the MagicHD application: <<_magichd_menu,menu>> -> View -> Full Screen.

MagicQ will remember the position and size of the window for when you next open it.

=== Adding Media
* From the MagicQ PC application: menu -> <<magicq_menu,Media Player>> -> Convert file, or
* From the MagicHD application: <<_magichd_menu,menu>> -> Media -> Convert file
* Select the file you want to convert and press Open.
* Select the folder and file you want to convert to.
* Press Convert.

Wait for conversion to take place. <<_status,Progress>> is reported on the HUD, and in the input display window
(bottom right) in MagicQ PC.

=== Converting Existing Media
* From the MagicQ PC application: menu -> <<magicq_menu,Media Player>> -> Convert Media
* From the MagicHD application: <<_magichd_menu,menu>> -> Media -> Convert Media

Once MagicHD is running, the *Convert Media* action allows you to force it to convert files already in
the <<files,convert folder>>. 
This means you can prepare media when MagicHD is not running. 
This is worth while if you are preparing a lot of content: if MagicHD is running it will keep trying
to convert files as you edit their names and move them around (unless you prepare the files elsewhere).

[NOTE]
Everything under <<files,convert folder>> will be converted, regardless of file age or previous conversion status.


=== LED Wall
To setup MagicHD with a low resolution output (e.g. an LED wall):

If you are using the <<_stand_alone,stand-alone>> version, from the <<_magichd_menu,menu>> -> View -> Output on separate window.

* From the MagicQ PC application: menu -> <<magicq_menu,Media Player>> -> Window...
* From the MagicHD application: <<_magichd_menu,menu>> -> View -> Window...
* Use the <<_window_size_dialogue,window size dialogue>> to set the size and position of the window. 
* Select No Border 
* Select Fixed size.


=== Playing Audio
To play media that includes audio:

[white black-background]#media# -> MagicHD -> Layer 1 -> Locate

then select some media that has audio

[white black-background]#media# -> MagicHD -> Layer 1 -> Int

set <<_audio_gain,Audio Gain>> to a non-zero value.

[white black-background]#media# -> MagicHD -> Output -> Locate

[white black-background]#media# -> MagicHD -> Output -> Int

Ensure <<_audio_volume,Audio Volume>> is not zero.


To change audio output device:


Make sure the MagicHD window is not full screen, so that the menu bar is visible.

From <<_magichd_menu,the MagicHD menu>>: Media -> Audio Devices.
