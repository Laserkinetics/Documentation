== Output Layer
The output layer is used to control the overall appearance of the output from MagicHD.
The output layer acts on the sum total of the <<_media_layers,media>> and <<_text_layer,text>> layers:
they are effectively combined into one resulting image, which the output layer then manipulates.

Note that any setting that puts all or part of the output beyond the limits of the window, screen
or projector output will result in those parts of the output being clipped.

The <<_output_layer_3,DMX parameters>> for the layer allow you to control the following features.

=== Intensity
Intensity controls the overall brightness of the MagicHD video output.

Intensity controls the overall volume of the MagicHD audio output.

=== Position
Position controls where the MagicHD output appears within the window, screen or projected area.

=== Scale
Scale increases or reduces the size of the output.

=== Rotation
This parameter allows the output to be rotated within the extent of the window, screen or projected area.
The centre point is controlled by <<_position_3,Position>>.

=== Mirror/Flip
This parameter allows the output to be reflected, horizontally, vertically or both.

=== R/G/B
The R, G and B parameters allow the colour balance of the output to be altered directly. 

[NOTE]
This alters all layers at the same time.
For control of individual layers, use the colour parameters for that layer.

=== Colour Effect
Colour effect, along with the associated R, G and B effect parameters, allows you to alter the
overall colour of the MagicHD output in a number of ways.

These work in exactly the same way as for <<_colour_effect,the Media Layers>>.

[NOTE]
This alters all layers at the same time.
For control of individual layers, use the <<_colour_effect,colour effect parameter for that layer>>.

[[output_mask]]
=== Mask Folder and File, Invert, Mirror/Flip
The output layer can optionally use a mask to achieve shuttering, edge blending, scenery blanking,
or other effects. 
The mask is automatically stretched to fit the output layer and its opacity cannot be controlled.

The mask parameters work in exactly the same way as the <<_media_layers,Media Layer>> mask parameters
<<_mask_folder_and_file,folder/file>>, <<_mask_invert,invert>> and <<_mask_mirror_flip,mirror/flip>>.

=== Keystone
The keystone parameters apply keystone distortion to the output image:

[options="autowidth",frame="none",grid="none",cols="^5,^1,^5",valign="middle"]
|====
|image:images/keystone1.png[]|->|image:images/keystone2.png[]
|====

The 8 keystone parameters move the corners of the image within the output screen:

image::images/keystone3.png[]


The range of each parameter is the full screen width or height, with bottom left at (0,0) and
top right at (1,1). Parameter names match the encoder wheels on MagicQ consoles.

[TIP]
When setting up keystone it can help to turn on <<_hud_control_bitmask,the HUD grid>> as shown in
these screenshots. The grid also enables keystone configuration with no media playing.

=== HUD Control
The HUD control parameter turns the <<_head_up_display,HUD overlay>> on and off, and selects which layer's DMX parameters are displayed.
It is a bitmask, and details are given in <<_hud_control_bitmask,the DMX parameter description>>.

=== Audio Volume
This parameter controls the overall volume of audio from all media layers.
Audio volume is faded with output layer <<_intensity_3,intensity>>. 
Therefore DBO also kills audio output.
