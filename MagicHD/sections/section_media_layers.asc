== Media Layers
Each media layer can display either a movie, a static image, or play audio.
A <<_masks,mask>> can be used to control which parts of the layer are visible. 

The <<_media_layers_3,DMX parameters for the layer>> allow you to control the following features.

=== Intensity
Intensity is used to fade the layer into, or out of, the output. 
As a layer's intensity reduces, lower layers will show through.

Intensity also controls the audio volume for the layer.

=== Position
Position controls where the centre of the layer appears in the output.

=== Scale
Scale increases or reduces the size of the layer in the output. 

Note that when magnified, low resolution content can look poor.

=== Rotation
Rotation allows a layer to be rotated around its centre point. 
The centre point is controlled by <<_position,Position>>.

=== Mirror/Flip
Mirror and flip allow the layer to be reflected horizontally (mirror) or vertically (flip), or both.

=== Stretch
Stretch controls how the layer fills the screen. Every media file has an associated aspect ratio and
this might not match the aspect ratio of the screen or projector. 
Stretch controls how the two aspect ratios are reconciled:

=== R/G/B
The R, G and B parameters allow the colour balance of the layer to be altered directly.

=== Colour Effect
Colour effect, along with the associated R, G and B effect parameters, allows you to alter the
colour of the layer in a number of ways. Full details are in <<_colour_effect_3,the DMX parameter>>.

Here are some examples:

[options="autowidth,header",cols="^2,3*^1,<5"]
|====
| Colour Effect | FX R | FX G | FX B | Result
| Posterise     | 3    | 3    | 3    | Each of R,G,B quantised to 4 levels.
| Colourise     | 255  | 130  | 40   | Sepia
| Colourise     | 0    | 255  | 0    | Black & Green (``night vision'')
| Mask          | 0    | -    | -
|The layer is used as a mask. The lighter the image, the more transparent it is. 
If the image is black and white, white will show the layer below, and black will not (and will show as black).
| Key           | 85   | 128  | 255  | ``Green screen'' : any pure green will become transparent.
| RGB Select    | 3    | 2    | 1    | RGB -> BGR colour swap
| RGB Select    | 5    | 6    | 7    | Inverted colour
| RGB Select    | 8    | 8    | 8    | Inverted black and white
| RGB Select    | 0    | 2    | 0    | Green only (similar to Black & Green)
| RGB Select    | 0    | 4    | 0    | Black & Green
|====

[TIP]
====
A large number of effects are possible, and the best way to understand the parameters is to experiment.

The ChamSys masks media folder (folder 3) includes an HSL<<4>> colour chart and a TV test image. 
Both of these include solid colours and are very useful for testing out colour effects.
====

=== Blend
Blend controls how each layer is blended with the one below, in terms of colour and intensity. 
Blending takes place from the lowest layer upwards: Layer 2 blends with Layer 1, then Layer 3 blends
with the result of 1 and 2, and so on.

Normally layers are simply blended by brightness and transparency: when a layer is completely opaque
(full intensity, no mask), nothing can be seen through it. 
Normally, as a layer is faded, it becomes transparent so things below it start to show through. 
If a <<_masks,mask>> is applied, dark areas of the mask make the layer transparent, allowing layers beneath to show through.

=== Folder and File
These allow the <<_media,media>> for the layer to be selected. If either are zero, the layer is switched off.

=== Start and End Frame
Start and end frame allow frame-wise control of which part of a clip is played. 
The default values are a start frame of zero and an end frame of 16777215 (2^24^-1) which mean the whole file is to be used. 
If the end frame is less than the length of the clip, playback will stop (or loop) when the end frame is reached. 
Similarly playback can be started at any point in the file by setting the start frame.

To set the start and end frame accurately, you can use the <<_first_frame,First Frame>> or 
<<_last_frame,Last Frame>> <<_play_mode,Play Mode>> whilst changing the start or end frame values respectively. 

To take complete control of playback speed (e.g. to bounce a clip between two points in time to a beat), 
use <<_first_frame,First Frame play mode>>, then apply a ramp effect to the start frame channel.

[NOTE]
====
* Although any values can be set in the DMX channels, the actual start frame will never exceed the
end frame, nor will the end frame ever be earlier than the start frame.
* If you are using start and end frame to permanently edit a clip (i.e. you don't change them or
use a different part of the file in another cue), consider editing off-line since 

. the resulting file will be smaller and 
. using dedicated video editing software can produce better results.
* The values in the DMX channels refer directly to the frame numbers within the media. 
Frame numbers run continuously from 0 to the end of the file. 
* The time that a frame number equates to depends on the frame rate of the file.
* For audio-only <<_media,media>> the frame rate is 25 fps.

[TIP]
Turning on the <<_head_up_display,HUD>> for the layer being programmed will help since the start and
end frame markers are shown on <<_hud_anatomy,the media bar>>.

=== Speed
Use the speed parameter to control the speed and direction of media playback. 
Negative speeds cause playback in reverse. A speed of 0 stops playback (although see <<_pause,pause mode>>). 

Up to 2 times normal speed, every frame is played. Bear in mind, therefore, that playing an HD clip
x1.9 faster will nearly double the processing load for that layer. 
Above x2, frames are dropped to reduce the processing load. There is still an increased load for
all but whole number multipliers: at x4.7, 3 out of every 4 frames are dropped, so the remaining
load is x1.7.

Since there is an inherent loss of quality at high playback speeds (because the human brain can't
process the imagery so well), consider the quality and resolution of the source material carefully.

=== Play Mode
Play mode allows a movie clip to be played in a number of different ways:

==== Once
The movie is played one, from the start frame to the end frame, controlled by the <<_speed,speed parameter>>.

Playback finishes on the last frame, which is held. 
If playback is in reverse (negative speed) the last frame is actually the start frame.

==== Once-then-black
The same as <<_once,Once>>, except the layer automatically blacks out after the last frame. 
This removes the need to set, and accurately time, a second cue to fade the layer at the end.

==== Loop
The same as <<_once,Once>>, except playback loops to the first frame after the last frame. 

When playing forwards, first = start and last = end. When backwards, first = end and last = start.

==== Bounce
The same as <<_loop,Loop>>, except the direction automatically changes each time. 

Note that the <<_speed,speed parameter>> is automatically reversed, so that changes in magnitude do not
suddenly reverse the direction if the sign of the speed does not match the direction. 
i.e. once the first reverse has taken place, only the magnitude of the speed parameter has any
effect unless the speed crosses zero, where the direction of bounce would also change.

==== First frame
The current first frame is always shown. Although playback is therefore not ``dynamic'', <<_start_and_end_frame,the start
frame parameter>> can be altered in real time to control playback.

==== Last frame
The current last frame is always shown. Although playback is therefore not ``dynamic'', the <<_start_and_end_frame,end
frame parameter>> can be altered in real time to control playback.

==== Pause
Playback is paused at whatever the current frame is. 
This mode can be used in conjunction with other modes, and cues, to achieve more complex playback effects. 
For example it allows playback to be paused without setting the speed to zero, so playback can be
restarted with the previous speed. The ``resume'' cue does not need to have the playback speed programmed.

==== Next frame
Advances the frame that is displayed, according to the <<_speed,speed parameter>> (i.e. direction and frame
skipping for high speeds still apply), then automatically pauses. 
The mode must be changed away (e.g. to <<_pause,Pause>>), then back, before this mode can change the frame again.

[TIP]
<<_pause,Pause>> can be used in conjunction with <<_next_frame,Next Frame>> (or other modes) to
 achieve more complex playback effects such as moving through a slide show.

=== Transition
_Not implemented yet._

=== Mask Opacity
This parameter controls how opaque the <<_masks,mask>> is. 
If the opacity is full, the mask has complete control over the transparency of the layer. 
As the opacity is reduced, the mask has less effect: black areas that would have been completely
transparent becomes less so, allowing less of the lower layers to show through.
As opacity reduces to zero, the mask is effectively switched off.

=== Mask Folder and File
These allow the <<_masks,mask>> for the layer to be selected. If either are zero, no mask is selected. 
If a non-image file is selected (i.e. a movie, audio or text file) the mask will have no effect.

=== Mask Invert
This parameter allows the intensity of the <<_masks,mask>> to be <<_mirroring_and_inverting,inverted>>. 
This means that what would be fully transparent becomes fully opaque and vice-versa.

The same mask can be used in two layers, inverted in one layer, to produce synchronised masking
effects, as <<mask_example,shown in this example>>.

=== Mask Mirror/Flip
This allows the <<_mirroring_and_inverting,orientation of the mask>> to be controlled independently from that of the media file for the layer.

If anything other than this simple level of control is required, the mask must be used by itself
in a different layer so that it can be independently <<_position,positioned>> and <<_rotation,rotated>>.

=== Mask Stretch
This parameter governs how the aspect ratio of the <<_masks,mask>> image is matched to that of the layer's media.
As far as the mask is concerned, the screen that it is being stretched to is actually the media file. 
If, for example, the media is appearing letter-boxed, setting mask stretch to *Fill X & Y*
stretches the mask to the same extent as the media thereby altering the mask's aspect ratio.

=== Audio Gain
This parameter controls the audio level for the layer. A gain of zero turns off the audio playback.
Note that the range is 0 to 10. For most purposes 0.5 to 2.0 will suffice. High gains can be used to
boost very quiet clips.

This parameter is mainly intended to allows clips with different peak levels to be equalised.

=== Audio Pan
This parameter allows the stereo image to be moved from left to right.
