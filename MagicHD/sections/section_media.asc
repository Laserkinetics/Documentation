== Media
Media refers to movies, images, audio, and text files. MagicHD can display all common image formats,
and play almost any format of movie or sound file, although a number of restrictions apply. 
If you want to do anything other than play the entire movie forwards at normal speed the movie must contain only I-frames<<2>>.
This is because playing backwards, skipping frames, or randomly accessing points within the clip
requires that any frame can be displayed by itself. Performance will also be affected by file size,
so consideration must be given to the quality (i.e. degree of compression) of the media.

Media is always addressed by a pair of DMX channels: <<_folder_and_file,folder and file>>. 
Wherever a media file can be selected, you will find the folder/file parameters. 
If MagicHD can't make sense of the selected file, in the context, it will be ignored. 
For example an audio file could be selected as a mask, but it will not have any effect because it is not an image. 
When selecting media, if either the folder or file is zero, the effect is `no selection'.

MagicHD translates <<_folder_and_file,DMX folder/file>> values into actual filenames by looking in
an <<files,index file>>. For MagicHD to be able to open a media file, the file must be in the index.
The index file is automatically generated and the user is not expected to read or edit it.

=== Adding Media
MagicHD is supplied with a library of basic content to get you started, but most users will want to
add their own content. Folders 1 to 9 are reserved for ChamSys libraries, and you are free to use
folders 10 to 255 in any way you like. Folder and file numbers do not have to be sequential.

Internally MagicHD stores media in numbered folders. Within each folder the file names start with
a number. The folder and file number are the <<_folder_and_file,DMX folder/file parameters>> used to select that file.
An <<files,index file>> is used to tell MagicHD which files to actually use. For MagicHD to be
able to use a new file it must be named correctly, placed in the right folder, and added to the
index. To simplify this process, it is automated:

==== Automatic Conversion
MagicHD monitors a folder called *convert*. When media files are added to that folder they are
automatically converted (if required) then moved to the show's media folders. Once converted, the
files are added to MagicHD's media index and can be used right away (without restarting). 

Files must be placed in a subfolder, under *convert*, whose name starts with a number (nnn, below).
This number is taken to be the folder number of the resulting media file. The rest of the folder
name is optional and is ignored by MagicHD. The file's name must start with a number (fff, below)
then an underscore. This number is taken to be the media's number within its folder.
The rest of the filename, after the underscore, is copied with spaces converted to underscores.
User folders start from 10 and file numbers start from 1:

....
    .../MagicQ PC
          `- convert
                +- nnn_folder_name
                :    `- fff_file_name.mov
....

Monitoring for new files, and converting them, are background activities and do not impact playback.
MagicHD only looks for changes to files, or the addition of files or folders. 
Any files already in place when MagicHD starts will be ignored. 
To trigger conversion of existing files just edit the file or folder name: adding or removing a
leading zero is sufficient. 
From the MagicQ PC menu, <<magicq_menu,Media Player>> -> Convert Media can be used to force MagicHD to 
re-convert everything in the *convert* folder. 
This can be useful if new media has been prepared _in situ_ before starting MagicHD.
The criteria for triggering conversion (rather than just copying the media) are:

[options="header",width="75%",cols="1,4"]
|====
|Movie content|Action
|Non I-frames|
Converted to .mp4 (H.264 video<<3>>) with all I-frames. Note that this process decompresses the video, usually resulting in a much larger file than the original.
|Audio|
Converted to 2-channel stereo 16 bit PCM if present.
|Video codec|
Any content encoded with the jpeg2000 or cinepak codecs is converted to H.264. These codecs have been found to cause problems with thumbnail extraction.
|Pixel Format|
MagicHD can only decode a fixed number of pixel formats (the representation of colour data within each frame). Content that uses unknown formats is converted to H.264 with a known pixel format.
|====

Pictures and text files are copied unchanged, as are any movies or sound files that already meet the criteria above.

If you wish to exercise full control over the quality and format of your content, prepare it offline
before placing it in the conversion area. If the content meets the basic criteria of all I-frames
and no audio, it will not be converted, thus preserving the original quality and format.

This diagram illustrates the relationship between the *convert* folder and the resulting media:

Note:

. 3_concert.mov was converted to .mp4 because it was compressed video.
. Two files share the same number. MagicHD will always choose the youngest file (i.e. the most
recently converted or added) so 030_mask2a.jpg will be in the index because it will be converted after
030_mask2.jpg.

==== Manual Conversion
To simplify the conversion process you can use the "Convert File" <<_magichd_menu,menu>> option.
This allows you to choose a file, then choose where it goes in the media index. 
MagicHD will then convert or copy the file and add it to the index.

==== Deployment
To simplify deploying the media for a show, and deploying media from one player to another, MagicHD
performs some automatic housekeeping processes in the background:

* checks for new files in the *convert* directory
* checks that the <<files,index file>> is present
* checks that there are up-to-date thumbnails for all media.

Because of these automatic checks, it is possible to manage your media content directly in the show
folder by editing the folder and file numbering. When finished, simply delete the index file and
thumbnail folder, then start MagicHD. 
Alternatively, use the <<_settings,menu>> options Media -> Rebuild Index and Media -> Rebuild Thumbnails.

==== Notes
Please note the following points:

* Monitoring and conversion take place in the background so that they do not impact media playback.
This means it is possible to add media during a show, but this *is not* recommended.
It also means conversion, and index or thumbnail regeneration, do not start immediately.

* MagicHD only checks periodically for new files, out of date index, and missing thumbnails, so the
conversion process will not start immediately when a new file is added. 
The conversion process can last a significant time if large movies are involved.

* The conversion process is:
** new files are converted,
** the index is updated,
** out of date thumbnails are regenerated

* While media is being converted, the thumbnails displayed in MagicQ's media window will be out of date.
Once the thumbnails are ready the combined version will show new thumbnails as soon as you change
folder in the media window. 
For remote servers, press the RELOAD THUMBS button (or shift for RELOAD ALL THUMBS):

// fix width to stop it inflating to huge size in PDF
image::images/reload_thumbs.png["reload thumbs screenshot",scaledwidth="33%"]

* Until the index has been rebuilt, MagicHD will not be able to display new media.

* If the contents of an existing file changes, MagicHD will not automatically reload it.
To force a reload, select a different file, then the original one.

* Feedback on progress is displayed on the <<_status,status line of the HUD>>, and recorded in the <<files,conversion log file>>.

* The results of media conversion are logged in a <<files,dedicated log file>>. 
For each file, some some basic statistics are reported, and the reason for conversion is logged.

* If you bypass the conversion process, and put new media directly into the show folders, MagicHD
will not get the chance to convert the file format to one that it understands.
MagicHD might not be able to read your media. If you choose to manage media files directly, *make
sure you test every file before the show*.

==== Tips
[TIP]
You can <<_status,monitor conversion progress>> by <<_hud_control,bringing up>> the <<_head_up_display,HUD>>.
[TIP]
To force MagicHD to reload a file that has changed, select a different file, then select the original one.
[TIP]
To force conversion of an existing file, edit the filename and add/remove a '0' at the start. This
doesn't change the file's number, but does cause a change that MagicHD will notice.

==== Thumbnail Regeneration
Each media file has a small thumbnail image associated with it. 
These thumbnails are used by MagicQ to display the contents of each media folder in the media window.

If any thumbnail file is found to be missing, or older than the corresponding media file, it will be automatically regenerated.

[options="header",cols="^1,<3",width="50%"]
|====
|Media|Thumbnail
|Movie|Frame at 10% duration^(1)^
|Picture|The picture
|Sound with attached picture^(2)^|The attached picture
|Sound|Fixed audio thumbnail
|Text|Fixed text thumbnail
|====
(1) Note that there is no way for MagicHD to know whether the chosen frame is representative or useful!

(2) For example, MPEG-4 audio file format (.m4a) supports attached pictures.


[TIP]
Thumbnail regeneration can be forced from <<_settings,the menu>>.

==== Index Regeneration
If the <<files,media index file>> is missing MagicHD will automatically regenerate it from the media files in the show.

Note that all media will be included in the index. 
There is no way to mark a file as not part of the show, other than obscuring its folder and/or file number
(e.g. add '_' or 'hide.' at the start of the folder or file name).

If multiple files or folders have the same number, MagicHD will take the youngest one. 
This favours recently added or changed media.
The old media will still be there, but will not be in the index. 
This also means that if you make a mistake during conversion or file copying, you will not lose any
media (unless the file name is exactly the same).

[TIP]
Index regeneration can be forced from <<_settings,the menu>>.

=== Masks
A mask is simply an image whose intensity is used to control the brightness of some other media behind it.
White areas are totally opaque and black totally transparent. Shades of grey scale between the two.
Any image can be used as a mask. Colour is converted to transparency by taking the black & white intensity of the image.
The simplest masks have just black and white areas, and hide the layer (allowing lower layers to be
seen) where they are black. 

Each <<_media_layers,media layer>> can select a mask whose position is automatically synchronised
with the media for that layer. As the layer is scaled, positioned or rotated, the mask is too.
This is the easiest way to use a masks.

Any media can be used as an independent mask by loading it as the <<_media,media>> in its <<_media_layers,own layer>>.
If the media has transparency, this will reveal the layer below automatically.
If you wish to control how the mask works, use the *Mask* <<_colour_effect_3,colour effect>>.
[TIP]
Using a layer as a dedicated mask means that movies can be used as masks as well as images.

The <<_output_layer,output layer>> can select a mask which is applied over all the <<_media_layers,media layers>>.
This can be used for static effects such as shuttering or edge blending; or dynamic effects that
apply to all layers at once.

[TIP]
For best results create your masks at the same resolution as your media, and use anti-aliasing to
minimise visible pixellation around curves etc.

==== Examples
If we look at one frame of video and a simple black & white arrow as a mask, the results are as follows:

[options="autowidth",frame="none",grid="none",cols="12,1,12,1,12,10",halign="center",valign="middle"]
|====
|image:images/output.png[]|[big]##+##|image:images/output2.png[]|[big]##=##|image:images/output3.png[]|
|====


If we have a more complicated grey scale mask, the effect is as follows:

[options="autowidth",frame="none",grid="none",cols="12,1,12,1,12,10",halign="center",valign="middle"]
|====
|image:images/output.png[]|[big]##+##|image:images/output4.png[]|[big]##=##|image:images/output5.png[]|
|====

And if we use a coloured mask, this is the result:

[options="autowidth",frame="none",grid="none",cols="12,1,12,1,12,10",halign="center",valign="middle"]
|====
|image:images/output.png[]|[big]##+##|image:images/output6.png[]|[big]##=##|image:images/output7.png[]|
|====

The examples above have the mask fully opaque. 
Reducing <<_mask_opacity,the mask's opacity>> reduces its effect. Here is a mask at 0.33 opacity:

[options="autowidth",frame="none",grid="none",cols="12,1,12,4,12,4",halign="center",valign="middle"]
|====
|image:images/output.png[]|[big]##+##|image:images/output8.png[]|[big]##&times;## 0.33 [big]##=##|image:images/output9.png[]|
|====

==== Mirroring and Inverting
One image can produce a number of different masks depending on its mirror/flip and invert parameters: 

[options="autowidth,header",cols=".^1h,4*^.^2"]
|====
|        |Normal|Mirrored|Flipped|Mirrored & flipped
|Normal  |image:images/output10.png[]|image:images/output11.png[]|image:images/output12.png[]|image:images/output13.png[]
|Inverted|image:images/output14.png[]|image:images/output15.png[]|image:images/output16.png[]|image:images/output17.png[]
|====

[[mask_example]]
If the same mask is used on two layers, inverted in one, the layers can be blended together as follows:

[options="autowidth",cols="3,5,1,5,1,5",grid="rows",halign="center",valign="middle"]
|====
|Layer 1|image:images/output18.png[]|[big]##+##|image:images/output21.png[]|[big]##=##|image:images/output22.png[]
|Layer 2|image:images/output.png[]|[big]##+##|image:images/output19.png[]|[big]##=##|image:images/output23.png[]
|Output Layer|||||image:images/output24.png[]
|====

Note that it is not actually necessary to use the mask on layer 1, since layer 2 overlays it anyway. The effect of the mask in layer 1 is that as layer 2 is faded out, layer 1 retains the black masked out area.

==== Notes
Whatever the aspect ratio of an image used as a mask, its ``screen'' is the extent of the media for that layer. 
If the <<_mask_stretch,mask is stretched>> to *Fill X & Y* it will fill the area occupied by the media, not
necessarily the whole screen. This can be overridden by the <<_mask_stretch,mask stretch parameter>> for the layer.


=== Audio
MagicHD can play most common audio formats directly. 
Audio files should be <<_adding_media,added>> just like any other media.

If audio is present in a movie file, it will automatically be converted to the correct format when
the media is <<_automatic_conversion,converted>> (even if the video is already in the correct format).
MagicHD will then play the audio content if the following criteria are met:

[width="50%",options="header",cols="1,2"]
|====
|Parameter|Value
|Direction|Forwards
|Speed|Normal (i.e. +1.0)
|Mode|Once, Once+Black, Loop
|Gain|> 0
|Intensity|> 0
|Audio Codec|16 bit PCM
|====

MagicHD does not play audio backwards or at different speeds, so <<_play_mode,Play Mode>> or <<_speed,speed>> that are not compatible will result in the audio output stopping for that layer.

==== Media Layers
Each <<_media_layers,media layer>> has an <<_audio_gain,audio gain>> and an <<_audio_pan,audio pan>>
control.
Gain sets the level for audio playback and should be used to balance the volume of the clip against
other clips in the show. 
It can be used to boost quiet clips or attenuate loud ones. 
Pan moves the stereo signal from left to right. 
The volume for each media layer is automatically faded with the layer's intensity.
Sections of audio-only media can be selected using the <<_start_and_end_frame, start and end frames>>,
just like any other media. In this case MagicHD uses a simulated 25 frames-per-second.

[NOTE]
====
* By default, gain for each layer is 0, so that audio is not heard. This is to prevent unwanted
surprises when playing clips that have audio that you don't want to hear. 
You must choose to set the gain above zero to hear audio.
* Pan uses a 3dB pan law, so a fully panned signal will increase the level in the L or R channel by
3dB. It doesn't sound louder because the signal has gone from the opposite channel, but it might
result in clipping if the gain is already high.
* There is no way to select audio only from a clip that has video. Reducing the layer intensity
to hide the video reduces the audio level too. Use an external tool to extract the audio from the
clip, and play it by itself.
====

==== Output Layer
The <<_output_layer,output layer>> has an <<_audio_volume,audio volume>> control.
The overall volume of all layers is controlled by the output layer's volume, which is also faded
with the output layer intensity.

==== Output Device
The audio output device can be chosen from the <<_magichd_menu,MagicHD application menu>> (Media -> Audio devices).
The list of devices is provided by the operating system: MagicHD simply allows the user to choose one.
The output device can be changed while MagicHD is running, but of course this will interrupt any
audio that is playing. MagicHD remembers the selected device in the show file (combined version)
or its settings file (stand-alone version). 

If the list of audio devices changes, MagicHD won't change audio output, but the menu might not show
the right selection. Select a different device to ensure the setting is correct. 
Similarly, if the list of devices changes when MagicHD is not running, the setting it has saved in
the show file might be out of synch with the new device list.

==== Status
The <<_head_up_display,HUD>> shows audio level superimposed on the layer's intensity, next to its
thumbnail. If the level is peaking, the display goes bright.

If a layer has audio but it is not being played for some reason (e.g. gain is zero) a "no audio" icon
is displayed over the thumbnail indicating lack of audio.

If a layer has audio but no video an animated thumbnail is shown on the <<_head_up_display,HUD>> and
in the MagicQ media window. This shows you that an audio file is selected.

[TIP]
If you are having problems playing audio use the <<_head_up_display,HUD>> to examine the status.
